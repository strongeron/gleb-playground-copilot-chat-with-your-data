AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\n\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\n\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\n\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\n\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\n\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\n\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\n\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\n\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\n\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\n\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\n\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\n\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\n\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\n\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\n\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\n\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\n\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\n\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\n\\n### 4.

Retailers Deploy AI In-Store and Online\\n\\nThe retail sector is one that could potentially reap huge benefits from the use of AI.\\n\\nPredictions show the market for AI in retail growing at a [CAGR of more than 30%](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-retail-market-101968) through 2028. The market will hit $31.18 billion that year, according to estimates.\\n\\nAs of 2024, [40% of retailers are already using AI in some form](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1400301/ai-mv-and-cv-use-retail/).\\n\\nAnd the use of AI is continuing to grow.\\n\\nIn the Retail Technology Study, [40% of retail organizations](https://risnews.com/retail-tech-study-2022?from=gate) said shopper tracking capability was going to be one of their top tech investments within the next two years.\\n\\nLocation-based marketing, digital devices, and computer vision also made the list with more than one-third of retailers saying they’ll focus on those tech solutions in the next two years.\\n\\n***![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)  \\nRetail leaders are planning to invest heavily in AI in the next two years.***\\n\\n![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)\\n\\nOne of the most obvious uses of [AI in retail](https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-implement-ai-self-checkout-in-retail-if-you-are-not-amazon) is at checkout.\\n\\nStores like Amazon Go track customers through the store via computer vision. When a person puts an item in a physical cart, the computer vision catches which product it is and adds it to a virtual cart of sorts. When the person leaves the store, their digital wallet is charged accordingly.\\n\\nRetailers are also using [AI for inventory management](https://addepto.com/blog/ai-in-inventory-management/).\\n\\nAI systems can monitor stock levels in the warehouse and on shelves. When stock is running low, the system can automatically notify the proper channels and decrease the time it takes to replenish the product supply.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)  \\nSearch volume for “warehouse automation” has increased by 103% over the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)\\n\\nMcKinsey reports that businesses that adopt [AI-enabled supply chains](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution) see a 15% improvement in logistics costs and a 35% improvement in inventory levels.\\n\\nAI also enables retailers to utilize dynamic pricing.\\n\\nWith data from the retailer, competitors, and customers, AI can be used to [adjust pricing in real time](https://segwitz.com/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-retail-industry/) and maximize profits.\\n\\nRetailers that use electronic shelf labels and AI-enabled dynamic pricing have the potential to [increase profit by 33%](https://revionics.com/blog/electronic-shelf-labels-price-optimization).\\n\\nOne of the most recent developments for retailers is generative AI.\\n\\nFor instance, [Shopify Magic](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-product-descriptions) was released in early 2023 as a tool that will write ecommerce product descriptions for retailers.\\n\\n***![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)  \\nShopify Magic enables retailers to create product descriptions in seconds.***\\n\\n![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)\\n\\nShopify says they’ll be adding more tools with AI in the near future.\\n\\nRetailers are also utilizing generative AI to create in-store displays.\\n\\nBy inserting a few prompts into a program like DALL-E, retailers can come up with a visual concept and merchandising imagery.\\n\\nOne retailer said her team typically spends a week brainstorming and [creating imagery for a new in-store design](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/in-store-innovation/how-store-design-teams-are-unlocking-tangible-value-from-ai-platforms).\\n\\nWith AI, they were able to do it in just eight hours.\\n\\n***![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)  \\nAn example of an AI-generated concept for a luxury fashion store.***\\n\\n![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)\\n\\nApparel companies are also using generative AI to create hundreds of recommended outfit combinations that appear on their websites and apps.\\n\\nBy working with the company [Stylitics](https://stylitics.com/), Puma was able to [increase conversions by 235%](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/inventory-merchandising/puma-using-ai-powered-styling-brainstorm-with-customers-increase-aov-stylitics-visual-merchandising) and session duration by 334%.\\n\\n***![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)  \\nStylitics’ AI-powered solution puts together outfit combinations and replaces outfit pieces as they go out of stock.***\\n\\n![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)\\n\\n### 8.

Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\n\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\n\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\n\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\n\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\n\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven't been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\n\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\n\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\n\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\n\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\n\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\n\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\n\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\n\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\n\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\nThe [AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\n\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\n\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\n\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen. In the coming years, the vulnerabilities of AI may be exposed, and governments, agencies, and consumers will have to decide how to balance the risks and benefits.\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\n![newsletter banner](https://explodingtopics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/trends-database-blog-cta.png)\\n\\n#### Reveal More Competitor Secrets for Free\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nNewsletter Signup\\n\\nBy clicking “Subscribe” you agree to Semrush Privacy Policy and consent to Semrush using your contact data for newsletter purposes\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:120,height:120/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:64,height:64/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n\\nJosh Howarth\\n\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\n\\nJosh is the Co-Founder and CTO of Exploding Topics.\\nJosh has led Exploding Topics product development from the first line of co...

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3.

Launched in 1999 as part of an Intel research project, OpenCV has since become a cornerstone in the computer vision community. Its extensive library of algorithms supports a wide array of applications, including facial recognition, object detection and motion tracking. The longevity and versatility of OpenCV underscore the enduring impact of open source AI initiatives. Another prominent player in the open source AI landscape is OpenNN, a neural network library that excels in predictive analytics. Developed by Artelnics, OpenNN has found applications in customer intelligence and industry-specific analytics, demonstrating the practical value of open source AI in business contexts.\\n\\n7. Agentic AI\\n-------------\\n\\nAgentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, offering a level of autonomy and decision-making capability that sets it apart from traditional AI systems. This advanced form of AI is designed to operate independently, making decisions and adapting to changing environments with minimal human intervention. Unlike its predecessors, agentic AI can analyse complex situations, formulate strategies and execute multi-step tasks to achieve predefined goals. At its core, agentic AI employs sophisticated algorithms that enable it to understand and interpret natural language instructions, develop action plans and adjust its approach based on real-time feedback.\\n\\nThis adaptability allows it to optimise workflows, enhance customer service experiences and streamline operations across various industries. For instance, in financial services, agentic AI excels at fraud detection by analysing vast amounts of data and autonomously initiating resolution workflows when issues are identified. Its ability to learn from interactions and improve over time positions agentic AI as a powerful tool for enterprises seeking to boost efficiency and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.\\n\\n6.AI in scientific research\\n---------------------------\\n\\nAI in scientific research\\n\\nAI is rapidly transforming scientific research across numerous disciplines, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, hypothesis generation, and experimental design.

These advancements not only save time but also enhance the quality of work output, demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI in boosting workplace efficiency.\\n\\n2. Gen AI democratisation\\n-------------------------\\n\\nGen AI\\n\\nGen AI has emerged as a powerful force in democratising innovation, placing sophisticated tools in the hands of individuals across various sectors. This technological leap forward has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for creative and analytical endeavours, enabling a broader range of users to harness AI's capabilities without extensive technical expertise.\\n\\nThe impact of this democratisation is particularly evident in the business world, where Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be using Gen AI APIs and models in production environments, a stark increase from less than 5% in 2023.\\n\\nThis shift signifies a move towards more inclusive and efficient business practices, with AI tools being integrated into everyday applications. For instance, sales teams can now utilise AI-powered chatbots and proposal generators to streamline their operations, enhancing productivity without the need for extensive data science teams.\\n\\nHowever, this widespread adoption is not without its challenges. A Boston Consulting Group study revealed that over half of executives surveyed are actively discouraging the use of generative AI due to a lack of understanding, whilst 37% are in a state of experimentation without proper policies or controls in place.\\n\\n1. Multimodal AI\\n----------------\\n\\n![Image 4: Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fD9SiYSpiwE/hqdefault.jpg)\\n\\nMultimodal AI represents a significant leap forward in AI, combining various data types such as text, images, audio, and video to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Unlike traditional unimodal systems that rely on a single data type, multimodal AI integrates diverse inputs, enabling it to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and contextual awareness.\\n\\nAt its core, multimodal AI comprises three key components: the input module, fusion module, and output module. The input module consists of multiple unimodal neural networks, each handling a different data type. The fusion module then processes and aligns the information from each modality, employing techniques such as early fusion to concatenate raw data. Finally, the output module delivers results that are often richer and more nuanced than those produced by unimodal systems\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_Explore the latest edition of_[_AI Magazine_](https://aimagazine.com/magazines)_and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,_[_Tech & AI LIVE_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_._\\n\\n_Discover all our_[_upcoming events_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_and secure your tickets today._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_AI Magazine_ _is a_[_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)_brand_\\n\\nTags\\n----\\n\\n[Ai](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Ai)[Technology](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Technology)[Top 10](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Top%2010)\\n\\nGlobal Events Program\\n\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/original/56b0636423c3c19c8bae6799794d7e5a:1711177fd9997efefa2485128289204e/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025-dark-logo.png)\\n\\n[Join us in Singapore on November 4](https://technologymagazine.com/events/tech-and-ai-live/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025)Attend Now\\n\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/9e903a884b23ac5e51801f561ae2e97c:396c4e0243970d67716f10a1f9e1881f/01-cover-ai-may2025.jpg)![Image 7](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/ca43aa688cdfe32da87b5e020a382af2:f54805cdfedc8a8764c8bd0dcc83d8ee/01-cover-ai-mar2025.jpg)![Image 8](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/fa38760b56c6ad79a5cec622275cb943:65aa8a8a2856761ad616a73c794fef31/00-cover-ai-jan2025.jpg)\\n\\n[Read Now](https://aimagazine.com/magazine)\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n*   [Is ‘Zero Trust’ the Future of Data Centre Security?

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\n\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\n\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\n\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\n\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\n\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\n\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\n\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\n\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\n\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\n\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\n\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\n\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\n\\n### 4. AI Helps Improve Healthcare Outcomes\\n\\nOver the last year, in particular, AI has been incredibly transformative in the healthcare industry.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)  \\nSearch volume for “healthcare AI” has increased 426% over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)\\n\\n**Adoption among hospitals is surging — [90% of hospitals](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/90-of-hospitals-have-artificial-intelligence-strategies-in-place) have an AI strategy and 75% of hospital executives say AI initiatives are critical.**\\n\\nAI, along with machine learning, is [speeding up several processes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/02/16/ai-for-health-and-hope-how-machine-learning-is-being-used-in-hospitals/?sh=1765c88a55be) in hospitals. This includes tasks like scanning handwritten data into an online platform, recording audio from doctor-patient conversations and converting it to text notes, and identifying patients for research studies.\\n\\nThis technology is also becoming an essential tool in the midst of a hospital staffing crisis.\\n\\nIn 2021, hospital staff turnover [grew 6.4%](https://www.nsinursingsolutions.com/Documents/Library/NSI_National_Health_Care_Retention_Report.pdf) to stand at nearly 26%.\\n\\n***![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)  \\nHospital turnover in 2021 was nearly 8 points higher than in 2017.***\\n\\n![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)\\n\\nNearly [334,000 medical clinicians](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/finding-right-candidates-keeping-them-ai-aiding-healthcare-industry-meets) left the workforce in 2021 alone.\\n\\nImplementing AI solutions helps bear the brunt of this staffing shortage.\\n\\nIn one survey, 58% of hospital executives said AI was very or often effective in [improving operational performance](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-healthcare/).\\n\\nMany hospitals are turning to AI-powered staffing platforms like [DirectShifts](https://www.directshifts.com).\\n\\n***![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)  \\nThe DirectShifts platform utilizes AI to match job seekers with hospitals.***\\n\\n![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)\\n\\nThis platform uses AI to match clinicians with hospital job postings. The majority of these positions are per-diem, which are employees that hospitals may only need when the census is high.\\n\\nThere are currently more than 850,000 clinicians on the platform.\\n\\nSome hospitals are easing the burden placed on nurses by investing in AI systems that help monitor patients.\\n\\n[Ouva’s AI-based platform](https://www.ouva.co/) constantly analyzes patient behavior and potential risks.\\n\\n***![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)  \\nA view from Ouva’s dashboard.***\\n\\n![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)\\n\\nThe platform takes data from optical sensors and alerts nurses when high-risk patients have left their beds. It also monitors things like nurse visits, meal delivery, and arrival and discharge of patients.\\n\\nAI has the potential to impact the healthcare industry in numerous other ways, as well.\\n\\nDrug development, disease diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans are just a few ways AI might be put to work in the future.\\n\\nInvestors are paying attention to this sector, too.\\n\\nMore than [$1.6 billion](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjH59nO38_9AhVQnGoFHat-CgQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.crunchbase.com%2Fhealth-wellness-biotech%2Fnested-cancer-treatment%2F&usg=AOvVaw3T5nvL1uRtmCpuUiV6FdWA) was invested in drug discovery startups in 2022.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)  \\nSearch volume for “pharmaceutical AI” has grown 300% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)\\n\\nIn one example, Microsoft continues to invest in healthcare AI.\\n\\nThe tech giant has partnered with [Paige](https://paige.ai) in order to apply AI technology to [improve cancer diagnosis](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005266/en/Paige-Collaborates-with-Microsoft-to-Transform-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-with-the-Use-of-Pathology-AI) and patient care.\\n\\nPaige was the first company to receive FDA approval for using AI in digital pathology.\\n\\n***![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)  \\n[Paige’s AI tool](https://paige.ai/) helps pathologists identify regions that are likely to harbor cancer.***\\n\\n![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)\\n\\n### 5.

Computer Vision Boosts Efficiency Across Industries\\n\\n[Computer vision](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/computer-vision.html) is a segment of AI that allows computers to interpret information from images and videos, and act on that information.\\n\\nToday’s computer vision systems are more accurate than humans and react quicker than humans.\\n\\nFor example, computer vision [boosts defect detection in manufacturing by 90%](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/documents/infographics/2019/en-computer-vision-110208.pdf).\\n\\nIt can be used for everything from monitoring pipelines and crops to identifying counterfeit money and areas of concern in cancer patients.\\n\\n***![computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/2Bp7KdBJQ4yqumhMKbkm)  \\nComputer vision technology has far-reaching implications.***\\n\\n![computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/2Bp7KdBJQ4yqumhMKbkm)\\n\\nWhile the concept of computer vision has been around since the 1950s, the advent of deep learning technology is enabling computer vision to be used in a wide range of applications that simply weren't possible in previous years.\\n\\nIn one survey, [nearly 30% of business leaders](https://www.shutterstock.com/developers/whitepaper-data-quality-for-trustworthy-computer-vision?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=computer-vision-whitepaper-2022&utm_campaignid=7013Z000002w6FhQAI) said they’ve seen a growing demand for computer vision solutions. More than half of them were most excited about object tracking and identification through computer vision.\\n\\nComputer vision is one way in which manufacturers are jumping into the [Industry 4.0 trend](https://voxel51.com/blog/how-computer-vision-is-changing-manufacturing-in-2023/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ujrdWXKoRNUgMpLudKKA)  \\nSearch interest for “AI in manufacturing” is up 480% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ujrdWXKoRNUgMpLudKKA)\\n\\nThis is an industry that’s suffering from huge staffing shortages. Up to [7.9 million manufacturing jobs](https://www.kornferry.com/content/dam/kornferry/docs/pdfs/KF-Future-of-Work-Talent-Crunch-Report.pdf) will go unfilled by 2030, resulting in unrealized revenue totaling $607.14 billion.\\n\\n***![future-of-work-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VnpO60fJR7S96Gd23fRL)  \\nThe shortage of workers in manufacturing is expected to get much worse in the coming years.***\\n\\n![future-of-work-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VnpO60fJR7S96Gd23fRL)\\n\\nBy using computer vision, manufacturers are increasing the efficiency and performance of their facilities, as well as reducing staffing numbers.\\n\\n[Detecting anomalies](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/business-operations-room-blog/2022/computer-vision-manufacturing-ai.html) is one important role of computer vision in manufacturing.\\n\\nA computer vision system can track every step of the production process. If a step is missed or something is done out of order, an alarm is set off.\\n\\nIn addition, the system knows how long a production cycle should take and can detect faults if the cycle runs too fast.\\n\\nFinally, when a faulty product is detected, workers can look up the item by its serial number to watch exactly what happened during the manufacturing process.\\n\\n[Instrumental](https://instrumental.com/) offers an AI/computer vision system that provides issue discovery and quality monitoring for electronics manufacturers. The system also performs end-to-end failure analysis.\\n\\n***![instrumental-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/qpY4wu4TFCRHjKWijFgm)  \\nInstrumental’s AI system allows manufacturers to find problems and fix them fast.***\\n\\n![instrumental-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/qpY4wu4TFCRHjKWijFgm)\\n\\nAccording to the company, their system results in a 43% reduction in rework and a 3x gain in product engineering efficiency.\\n\\nCompanies that install the system see a positive ROI in less than 60 days, they say.\\n\\nComputer vision is also being deployed in response to natural disasters and climate change issues.\\n\\nOne California startup, aptly named [Rain](https://www.rain.aero/), is using computer vision to fight wildfires.\\n\\n***![rain-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/FZmlGQoURbKeBYTGX2JY)  \\nRain’s aircraft is able to stay in the air for over an hour.***\\n\\n![rain-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/FZmlGQoURbKeBYTGX2JY)\\n\\nTheir product is an [unmanned autonomous helicopter](https://verticalmag.com/press-releases/rain-industries-announces-autonomous-firefighting-helicopter/) that uses AI and computer vision to deliver water to a wildfire before it grows out of control.\\n\\nThe company’s idea is to put these helicopters in high-risk areas that aren’t staffed by humans 24/7. If a wildfire broke out, the helicopter could be immediately deployed by a pilot at a remote location.\\n\\nThe project will be tested this year on real fires in California and the company projects they’ll build [200 helicopter stations](https://qz.com/firetech-forest-wildfire-startup-technology-1850205150) there.\\n\\nIn addition, a team at the University of Cambridge recently developed a [computer vision system](https://www.zmescience.com/science/this-new-app-can-measure-trees-much-faster-than-manual-methods/) that allows scientists to monitor forests and carbon sequestration from their smartphones.\\n\\n***![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)  \\nThe computer vision system developed by the University of Cambridge utilizes LiDAR sensors.***\\n\\n![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)\\n\\nThe error rate is 8%, which is lower than the error rate occurring when humans complete the task.\\n\\nAt the same time as it’s being deployed in a wide variety of industries, the technology of computer vision itself is being revolutionized.\\n\\nToday’s computer vision works by taking an image or series of images in still frames. Then the still frames are analyzed by the computer.\\n\\nHowever, one company is imagining computer vision that doesn’t need still frames.\\n\\n[Ubicept](https://www.ubicept.com/), a company formed in 2021, has developed computer vision that can [measure individual photons](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/10/ubicept-computer-vision/) instead of looking at still frames.\\n\\nThat process is faster and more reliable than traditional computer vision.\\n\\nIt’s especially beneficial for situations in which the camera needs to capture objects moving fast or objects in low light.\\n\\n***![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)  \\nUbicept’s [computer vision technology](https://www.ubicept.com/blog/viva-las-vegas) excels in low light and fast motion, two areas in which traditional computer vision falls short.***\\n\\n![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)\\n\\n### 7. Retailers Deploy AI In-Store and Online\\n\\nThe retail sector is one that could potentially reap huge benefits from the use of AI.\\n\\nPredictions show the market for AI in retail growing at a [CAGR of more than 30%](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-retail-market-101968) through 2028. The market will hit $31.18 billion that year, according to estimates.\\n\\nAs of 2024, [40% of retailers are already using AI in some form](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1400301/ai-mv-and-cv-use-retail/).\\n\\nAnd the use of AI is continuing to grow.\\n\\nIn the Retail Technology Study, [40% of retail organizations](https://risnews.com/retail-tech-study-2022?from=gate) said shopper tracking capability was going to be one of their top tech investments within the next two years.\\n\\nLocation-based marketing, digital devices, and computer vision also made the list with more than one-third of retailers saying they’ll focus on those tech solutions in the next two years.\\n\\n***![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)  \\nRetail leaders are planning to invest heavily in AI in the next two years.***\\n\\n![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)\\n\\nOne of the most obvious uses of [AI in retail](https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-implement-ai-self-checkout-in-retail-if-you-are-not-amazon) is at checkout.\\n\\nStores like Amazon Go track customers through the store via computer vision. When a person puts an item in a physical cart, the computer vision catches which product it is and adds it to a virtual cart of sorts. When the person leaves the store, their digital wallet is charged accordingly.\\n\\nRetailers are also using [AI for inventory management](https://addepto.com/blog/ai-in-inventory-management/).\\n\\nAI systems can monitor stock levels in the warehouse and on shelves. When stock is running low, the system can automatically notify the proper channels and decrease the time it takes to replenish the product supply.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)  \\nSearch volume for “warehouse automation” has increased by 103% over the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)\\n\\nMcKinsey reports that businesses that adopt [AI-enabled supply chains](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution) see a 15% improvement in logistics costs and a 35% improvement in inventory levels.\\n\\nAI also enables retailers to utilize dynamic pricing.\\n\\nWith data from the retailer, competitors, and customers, AI can be used to [adjust pricing in real time](https://segwitz.com/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-retail-industry/) and maximize profits.\\n\\nRetailers that use electronic shelf labels and AI-enabled dynamic pricing have the potential to [increase profit by 33%](https://revionics.com/blog/electronic-shelf-labels-price-optimization).\\n\\nOne of the most recent developments for retailers is generative AI.\\n\\nFor instance, [Shopify Magic](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-product-descriptions) was released in early 2023 as a tool that will write ecommerce product descriptions for retailers.\\n\\n***![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)  \\nShopify Magic enables retailers to create product descriptions in seconds.***\\n\\n![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)\\n\\nShopify says they’ll be adding more tools with AI in the near future.\\n\\nRetailers are also utilizing generative AI to create in-store displays.\\n\\nBy inserting a few prompts into a program like DALL-E, retailers can come up with a visual concept and merchandising imagery.\\n\\nOne retailer said her team typically spends a week brainstorming and [creating imagery for a new in-store design](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/in-store-innovation/how-store-design-teams-are-unlocking-tangible-value-from-ai-platforms).\\n\\nWith AI, they were able to do it in just eight hours.\\n\\n***![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)  \\nAn example of an AI-generated concept for a luxury fashion store.***\\n\\n![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)\\n\\nApparel companies are also using generative AI to create hundreds of recommended outfit combinations that appear on their websites and apps.\\n\\nBy working with the company [Stylitics](https://stylitics.com/), Puma was able to [increase conversions by 235%](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/inventory-merchandising/puma-using-ai-powered-styling-brainstorm-with-customers-increase-aov-stylitics-visual-merchandising) and session duration by 334%.\\n\\n***![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)  \\nStylitics’ AI-powered solution puts together outfit combinations and replaces outfit pieces as they go out of stock.***\\n\\n![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)\\n\\n### 8.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.\\\\xa0 AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers. \\\\xa0Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like \\\\xa0[OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions.\\\\xa0These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced\\\\xa0[new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents.

of 2024\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI Magazine examines the top 10 AI trends of 2024 to understand the developments of this year and see what could be on the agenda for 2025\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs we enter 2025, AI continues to reshape industries and redefine the boundaries of technological innovation. The rapid evolution of AI has ushered in a new era of digital transformation, with generative AI leading the charge. Investment in this groundbreaking technology is projected by [PWC](https://aimagazine.com/articles/examining-the-big-openai-and-pwc-enterprise-deal) to contribute a staggering US$15.7tn to the global economy in 2030,underscoring its pivotal role in shaping the future of business and society.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom revolutionising [healthcare](https://aimagazine.com/ai-applications/alphafold-3-google-deepmind-seeks-to-transform-healthcare) with AI-driven diagnostics to transforming [financial services](https://aimagazine.com/articles/ey-finance-leaders-turn-to-ai-to-solve-esg-data-problems) with intelligent algorithms, the impact of AI is far-reaching and profound.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, this technological leap forward also brings new challenges, particularly in the realms of ethics, regulation, and data security.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn light of this, AI Magazine presents a comprehensive list of the top 10 AI trends of 2024 to understand the AI developments of this year and gain a glimpse of what could be in store for 2025.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. AI governance and ethics\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI governance and ethics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI governance and ethics have become paramount concerns as artificial intelligence technologies continue to reshape our world. The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted by 193 countries in 2021, stands as a cornerstone in this field. This comprehensive framework emphasises four core values: respect for human rights, fostering just societies, environmental well-being, and diversity and inclusiveness. It interprets AI broadly, recognising the rapid pace of technological change and the need for future-proof policies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe recommendation outlines eleven key areas for policy actions, moving beyond high-level principles to practical strategies. These include sustainability, fairness, technical safety, accountability, explainability, and data stewardship. To support the implementation of these principles, UNESCO has established the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory. This platform serves as a vital resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, and civil society, offering country profiles, expert insights, and good practices in AI ethics and governance. The observatory\\\\'s AI Ethics and Governance Lab gathers contributions, research, and toolkits to address pressing challenges in responsible AI innovation, standards, and institutional capacities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9.AI talent demand\\\\\\\\n------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI talent demand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe demand for AI talent has skyrocketed in recent years, with job postings incorporating AI skills as a requirement surging by 130% over the last two years. This trend is particularly evident in the field of generative AI, where roles have seen an unprecedented 1,300% increase in demand. The surge reflects the critical importance of AI expertise in today\\\\'s rapidly evolving tech landscape, with machine learning and data science roles growing by 80% and 250%, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis dramatic shift in the job market has led to a significant skills shortage, with the International Data Corporation predicting that over 90% of companies will face IT skills shortages by 2026. In response, organisations are increasingly looking beyond traditional talent pools, with a 31% increase in demand for specialised skills across borders. This global approach to talent acquisition is reshaping recruitment strategies, as companies seek to build teams with the specialised skills needed to develop and implement AI-driven solutions. The trend towards skills-based hiring is further emphasised by the fact that 80% of companies are now prioritising becoming skills-based organisations, with a particular focus on AI and related technologies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. Open source AI\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen Source AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen source AI has emerged as a powerful force in the realm of technology, fostering collaboration and innovation on a global scale. This approach to AI development allows researchers, developers and organisations to freely access, modify and distribute AI systems, including datasets, code and model parameters. The transparency inherent in open source AI has led to significant advancements in various fields, from natural language processing to computer vision.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most notable examples of open source AI is OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library. Launched in 1999 as part of an Intel research project, OpenCV has since become a cornerstone in the computer vision community. Its extensive library of algorithms supports a wide array of applications, including facial recognition, object detection and motion tracking. The longevity and versatility of OpenCV underscore the enduring impact of open source AI initiatives. Another prominent player in the open source AI landscape is OpenNN, a neural network library that excels in predictive analytics. Developed by Artelnics, OpenNN has found applications in customer intelligence and industry-specific analytics, demonstrating the practical value of open source AI in business contexts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. Agentic AI\\\\\\\\n-------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAgentic AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAgentic AI represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, offering a level of autonomy and decision-making capability that sets it apart from traditional AI systems. This advanced form of AI is designed to operate independently, making decisions and adapting to changing environments with minimal human intervention. Unlike its predecessors, agentic AI can analyse complex situations, formulate strategies and execute multi-step tasks to achieve predefined goals. At its core, agentic AI employs sophisticated algorithms that enable it to understand and interpret natural language instructions, develop action plans and adjust its approach based on real-time feedback.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis adaptability allows it to optimise workflows, enhance customer service experiences and streamline operations across various industries. For instance, in financial services, agentic AI excels at fraud detection by analysing vast amounts of data and autonomously initiating resolution workflows when issues are identified. Its ability to learn from interactions and improve over time positions agentic AI as a powerful tool for enterprises seeking to boost efficiency and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6.AI in scientific research\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI in scientific research\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is rapidly transforming scientific research across numerous disciplines, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, hypothesis generation, and experimental design.

These advancements not only save time but also enhance the quality of work output, demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI in boosting workplace efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Gen AI democratisation\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGen AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGen AI has emerged as a powerful force in democratising innovation, placing sophisticated tools in the hands of individuals across various sectors. This technological leap forward has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for creative and analytical endeavours, enabling a broader range of users to harness AI\\\\'s capabilities without extensive technical expertise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe impact of this democratisation is particularly evident in the business world, where Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be using Gen AI APIs and models in production environments, a stark increase from less than 5% in 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shift signifies a move towards more inclusive and efficient business practices, with AI tools being integrated into everyday applications. For instance, sales teams can now utilise AI-powered chatbots and proposal generators to streamline their operations, enhancing productivity without the need for extensive data science teams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, this widespread adoption is not without its challenges. A Boston Consulting Group study revealed that over half of executives surveyed are actively discouraging the use of generative AI due to a lack of understanding, whilst 37% are in a state of experimentation without proper policies or controls in place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Multimodal AI\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4: Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fD9SiYSpiwE/hqdefault.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultimodal AI represents a significant leap forward in AI, combining various data types such as text, images, audio, and video to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Unlike traditional unimodal systems that rely on a single data type, multimodal AI integrates diverse inputs, enabling it to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and contextual awareness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt its core, multimodal AI comprises three key components: the input module, fusion module, and output module. The input module consists of multiple unimodal neural networks, each handling a different data type. The fusion module then processes and aligns the information from each modality, employing techniques such as early fusion to concatenate raw data. Finally, the output module delivers results that are often richer and more nuanced than those produced by unimodal systems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Explore the latest edition of_[_AI Magazine_](https://aimagazine.com/magazines)_and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,_[_Tech & AI LIVE_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Discover all our_[_upcoming events_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_and secure your tickets today._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_AI Magazine_ _is a_[_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)_brand_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTags\\\\\\\\n----\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Ai](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Ai)[Technology](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Technology)[Top 10](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Top%2010)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGlobal Events Program\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/original/56b0636423c3c19c8bae6799794d7e5a:1711177fd9997efefa2485128289204e/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025-dark-logo.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Join us in Singapore on November 4](https://technologymagazine.com/events/tech-and-ai-live/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025)Attend Now\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/9e903a884b23ac5e51801f561ae2e97c:396c4e0243970d67716f10a1f9e1881f/01-cover-ai-may2025.jpg)![Image 7](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/ca43aa688cdfe32da87b5e020a382af2:f54805cdfedc8a8764c8bd0dcc83d8ee/01-cover-ai-mar2025.jpg)![Image 8](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/fa38760b56c6ad79a5cec622275cb943:65aa8a8a2856761ad616a73c794fef31/00-cover-ai-jan2025.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Read Now](https://aimagazine.com/magazine)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelated Content\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   [Is ‘Zero Trust’ the Future of Data Centre Security?

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google\\\\'s all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\\\\\\\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI tools that use\\\\xa0[large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(And potentially disrupt Google\\\\'s [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\\\\\\\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal\\\\xa0or find a car to buy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of\\\\xa0[generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\\\\\\\\\"10 blue links\\\\\\\\\\\" with AI answers.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, \\\\\\\\\\\"AI search engine\\\\\\\\\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for \\\\\\\\\\\"Perplexity AI\\\\\\\\\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPerplexity has raised\\\\xa0[$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\\\\\\\\\"AI Overviews\\\\\\\\\\\" to many users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle\\\\'s AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd in the case of Google\\\\'s AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles\\\\xa0to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\\\\\\\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, what is NLP?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\'s basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\\\\\\\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\\\\\\\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 4.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text.

Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\n\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\n\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\n\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\n\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\n\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven't been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\n\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\n\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\n\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\n\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\n\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\n\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\n\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\n\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\n\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\nThe [AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\n\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\n\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\n\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen. In the coming years, the vulnerabilities of AI may be exposed, and governments, agencies, and consumers will have to decide how to balance the risks and benefits.\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\n![newsletter banner](https://explodingtopics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/trends-database-blog-cta.png)\\n\\n#### Reveal More Competitor Secrets for Free\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nNewsletter Signup\\n\\nBy clicking “Subscribe” you agree to Semrush Privacy Policy and consent to Semrush using your contact data for newsletter purposes\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:120,height:120/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:64,height:64/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n\\nJosh Howarth\\n\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\n\\nJosh is the Co-Founder and CTO of Exploding Topics.\\nJosh has led Exploding Topics product development from the first line of co...

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.\\\\xa0 AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers. \\\\xa0Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like \\\\xa0[OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions.\\\\xa0These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced\\\\xa0[new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine,\\\\xa0improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\\\\\\\n---------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelated Posts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\\\\\\\\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to\\\\xa0automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\\\\\\\\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\\\\\\\\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided\\\\xa0 Last year, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\\\\\\\\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTula Masterman\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubscribe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\\\\\\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\\\\\\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\\\\\\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\\\\\\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\\\\\\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\\\\\\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\\\\\\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases. In the next 24 months, a greater focus will be placed on functional and industry use cases.\\\\\\\\n*   The top barrier when implementing AI is the lack of both technical and day-to-day AI skills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Learn how to fuel your AI journey**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIDC’s study, which included more than 4,000 business leaders and AI decision-makers around the world, also identifies the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI. As businesses integrate new solutions, they navigate important considerations such as data privacy, responsible use and the need for investment in both technology and skills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo matter where you are in your cloud and AI transformation journey, Microsoft can help.

Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI tools that use\\\\xa0[large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(And potentially disrupt Google\\\\'s [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\\\\\\\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal\\\\xa0or find a car to buy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of\\\\xa0[generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\\\\\\\\\"10 blue links\\\\\\\\\\\" with AI answers.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, \\\\\\\\\\\"AI search engine\\\\\\\\\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for \\\\\\\\\\\"Perplexity AI\\\\\\\\\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPerplexity has raised\\\\xa0[$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\\\\\\\\\"AI Overviews\\\\\\\\\\\" to many users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle\\\\'s AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd in the case of Google\\\\'s AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles\\\\xa0to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\\\\\\\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, what is NLP?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\'s basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\\\\\\\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\\\\\\\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 4.

If a wildfire broke out, the helicopter could be immediately deployed by a pilot at a remote location.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe project will be tested this year on real fires in California and the company projects they’ll build [200 helicopter stations](https://qz.com/firetech-forest-wildfire-startup-technology-1850205150) there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, a team at the University of Cambridge recently developed a [computer vision system](https://www.zmescience.com/science/this-new-app-can-measure-trees-much-faster-than-manual-methods/) that allows scientists to monitor forests and carbon sequestration from their smartphones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)  \\\\\\\\nThe computer vision system developed by the University of Cambridge utilizes LiDAR sensors.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe error rate is 8%, which is lower than the error rate occurring when humans complete the task.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the same time as it’s being deployed in a wide variety of industries, the technology of computer vision itself is being revolutionized.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nToday’s computer vision works by taking an image or series of images in still frames. Then the still frames are analyzed by the computer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, one company is imagining computer vision that doesn’t need still frames.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Ubicept](https://www.ubicept.com/), a company formed in 2021, has developed computer vision that can [measure individual photons](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/10/ubicept-computer-vision/) instead of looking at still frames.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat process is faster and more reliable than traditional computer vision.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt’s especially beneficial for situations in which the camera needs to capture objects moving fast or objects in low light.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)  \\\\\\\\nUbicept’s\\\\xa0[computer vision technology](https://www.ubicept.com/blog/viva-las-vegas) excels in low light and fast motion, two areas in which traditional computer vision falls short.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 7. Retailers Deploy AI In-Store and Online\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe retail sector is one that could potentially reap huge benefits from the use of AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPredictions show the market for AI in retail growing at a [CAGR of more than 30%](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-retail-market-101968) through 2028. The market will hit $31.18 billion that year, according to estimates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs of 2024, [40% of retailers are already using AI in some form](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1400301/ai-mv-and-cv-use-retail/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd the use of AI is continuing to grow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the Retail Technology Study,\\\\xa0[40% of retail organizations](https://risnews.com/retail-tech-study-2022?from=gate) said shopper tracking capability was going to be one of their top tech investments within the next two years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLocation-based marketing, digital devices, and computer vision also made the list with more than one-third of retailers saying they’ll focus on those tech solutions in the next two years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)  \\\\\\\\nRetail leaders are planning to invest heavily in AI in the next two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most obvious uses of [AI in retail](https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-implement-ai-self-checkout-in-retail-if-you-are-not-amazon) is at checkout.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStores like Amazon Go track customers through the store via computer vision. When a person puts an item in a physical cart, the computer vision catches which product it is and adds it to a virtual cart of sorts. When the person leaves the store, their digital wallet is charged accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRetailers are also using [AI for inventory management](https://addepto.com/blog/ai-in-inventory-management/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI systems can monitor stock levels in the warehouse and on shelves. When stock is running low, the system can automatically notify the proper channels and decrease the time it takes to replenish the product supply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “warehouse automation” has increased by 103% over the past 5 years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMcKinsey reports that businesses that adopt [AI-enabled supply chains](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution) see a 15% improvement in logistics costs and a 35% improvement in inventory levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI also enables retailers to utilize dynamic pricing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith data from the retailer, competitors, and customers, AI can be used to [adjust pricing in real time](https://segwitz.com/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-retail-industry/) and maximize profits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRetailers that use electronic shelf labels and AI-enabled dynamic pricing have the potential to [increase profit by 33%](https://revionics.com/blog/electronic-shelf-labels-price-optimization).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most recent developments for retailers is generative AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, [Shopify Magic](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-product-descriptions) was released in early 2023 as a tool that will write ecommerce product descriptions for retailers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)  \\\\\\\\nShopify Magic enables retailers to create product descriptions in seconds.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShopify says they’ll be adding more tools with AI in the near future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRetailers are also utilizing generative AI to create in-store displays.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy inserting a few prompts into a program like DALL-E, retailers can come up with a visual concept and merchandising imagery.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne retailer said her team typically spends a week brainstorming and [creating imagery for a new in-store design](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/in-store-innovation/how-store-design-teams-are-unlocking-tangible-value-from-ai-platforms).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI, they were able to do it in just eight hours.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)  \\\\\\\\nAn example of an AI-generated concept for a luxury fashion store.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nApparel companies are also using generative AI to create hundreds of recommended outfit combinations that appear on their websites and apps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy working with the company [Stylitics](https://stylitics.com/), Puma was able to [increase conversions by 235%](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/inventory-merchandising/puma-using-ai-powered-styling-brainstorm-with-customers-increase-aov-stylitics-visual-merchandising) and session duration by 334%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)  \\\\\\\\nStylitics’ AI-powered solution puts together outfit combinations and replaces outfit pieces as they go out of stock.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 8.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration.

highlights the Top 10 trends of 2024\\n\\nAI Magazine examines the top 10 AI trends of 2024 to understand the developments of this year and see what could be on the agenda for 2025\\n\\nAs we enter 2025, AI continues to reshape industries and redefine the boundaries of technological innovation. The rapid evolution of AI has ushered in a new era of digital transformation, with generative AI leading the charge. Investment in this groundbreaking technology is projected by [PWC](https://aimagazine.com/articles/examining-the-big-openai-and-pwc-enterprise-deal) to contribute a staggering US$15.7tn to the global economy in 2030,underscoring its pivotal role in shaping the future of business and society.\\n\\nFrom revolutionising [healthcare](https://aimagazine.com/ai-applications/alphafold-3-google-deepmind-seeks-to-transform-healthcare) with AI-driven diagnostics to transforming [financial services](https://aimagazine.com/articles/ey-finance-leaders-turn-to-ai-to-solve-esg-data-problems) with intelligent algorithms, the impact of AI is far-reaching and profound.\\n\\nHowever, this technological leap forward also brings new challenges, particularly in the realms of ethics, regulation, and data security.\\n\\nIn light of this, AI Magazine presents a comprehensive list of the top 10 AI trends of 2024 to understand the AI developments of this year and gain a glimpse of what could be in store for 2025.\\n\\n10. AI governance and ethics\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAI governance and ethics\\n\\nAI governance and ethics have become paramount concerns as artificial intelligence technologies continue to reshape our world. The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted by 193 countries in 2021, stands as a cornerstone in this field. This comprehensive framework emphasises four core values: respect for human rights, fostering just societies, environmental well-being, and diversity and inclusiveness. It interprets AI broadly, recognising the rapid pace of technological change and the need for future-proof policies.\\n\\nThe recommendation outlines eleven key areas for policy actions, moving beyond high-level principles to practical strategies. These include sustainability, fairness, technical safety, accountability, explainability, and data stewardship. To support the implementation of these principles, UNESCO has established the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory. This platform serves as a vital resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, and civil society, offering country profiles, expert insights, and good practices in AI ethics and governance. The observatory's AI Ethics and Governance Lab gathers contributions, research, and toolkits to address pressing challenges in responsible AI innovation, standards, and institutional capacities.\\n\\n9.AI talent demand\\n------------------\\n\\nAI talent demand\\n\\nThe demand for AI talent has skyrocketed in recent years, with job postings incorporating AI skills as a requirement surging by 130% over the last two years. This trend is particularly evident in the field of generative AI, where roles have seen an unprecedented 1,300% increase in demand. The surge reflects the critical importance of AI expertise in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, with machine learning and data science roles growing by 80% and 250%, respectively.\\n\\nThis dramatic shift in the job market has led to a significant skills shortage, with the International Data Corporation predicting that over 90% of companies will face IT skills shortages by 2026. In response, organisations are increasingly looking beyond traditional talent pools, with a 31% increase in demand for specialised skills across borders. This global approach to talent acquisition is reshaping recruitment strategies, as companies seek to build teams with the specialised skills needed to develop and implement AI-driven solutions. The trend towards skills-based hiring is further emphasised by the fact that 80% of companies are now prioritising becoming skills-based organisations, with a particular focus on AI and related technologies.\\n\\n7. Open source AI\\n-----------------\\n\\nOpen Source AI\\n\\nOpen source AI has emerged as a powerful force in the realm of technology, fostering collaboration and innovation on a global scale. This approach to AI development allows researchers, developers and organisations to freely access, modify and distribute AI systems, including datasets, code and model parameters. The transparency inherent in open source AI has led to significant advancements in various fields, from natural language processing to computer vision.\\n\\nOne of the most notable examples of open source AI is OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library. Launched in 1999 as part of an Intel research project, OpenCV has since become a cornerstone in the computer vision community. Its extensive library of algorithms supports a wide array of applications, including facial recognition, object detection and motion tracking. The longevity and versatility of OpenCV underscore the enduring impact of open source AI initiatives. Another prominent player in the open source AI landscape is OpenNN, a neural network library that excels in predictive analytics. Developed by Artelnics, OpenNN has found applications in customer intelligence and industry-specific analytics, demonstrating the practical value of open source AI in business contexts.\\n\\n7. Agentic AI\\n-------------\\n\\nAgentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, offering a level of autonomy and decision-making capability that sets it apart from traditional AI systems. This advanced form of AI is designed to operate independently, making decisions and adapting to changing environments with minimal human intervention. Unlike its predecessors, agentic AI can analyse complex situations, formulate strategies and execute multi-step tasks to achieve predefined goals. At its core, agentic AI employs sophisticated algorithms that enable it to understand and interpret natural language instructions, develop action plans and adjust its approach based on real-time feedback.\\n\\nThis adaptability allows it to optimise workflows, enhance customer service experiences and streamline operations across various industries. For instance, in financial services, agentic AI excels at fraud detection by analysing vast amounts of data and autonomously initiating resolution workflows when issues are identified. Its ability to learn from interactions and improve over time positions agentic AI as a powerful tool for enterprises seeking to boost efficiency and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.\\n\\n6.AI in scientific research\\n---------------------------\\n\\nAI in scientific research\\n\\nAI is rapidly transforming scientific research across numerous disciplines, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, hypothesis generation, and experimental design. In genomics, AI algorithms can swiftly analyse genetic sequences to identify disease markers, whilst in drug discovery, machine learning models predict the efficacy of new compounds with remarkable accuracy. These advancements have led to significant time and cost reductions in research processes, with genomics seeing a 60% acceleration in research and a 50% reduction in costs.\\n\\nThe integration of AI in scientific research extends beyond data analysis. Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are revolutionising how researchers manage the ever-growing volume of scientific literature. These AI-powered tools can summarise vast collections of research papers, extracting key findings and methodologies, thus enabling scientists to stay abreast of developments in their field without the need to read through entire papers. Moreover, AI is fostering interdisciplinary research by integrating data and methodologies from different scientific fields, leading to innovative solutions for complex problems such as climate change and its socioeconomic impacts.\\n\\n5.Customisable AI\\n-----------------\\n\\nCustomisable AI\\n\\nCustomisable AI models have emerged as a powerful tool for businesses seeking to harness the full potential of AI. Unlike generic solutions, these bespoke models are tailored to address specific challenges and optimise performance in targeted areas. By aligning closely with a company's unique data sets and objectives, customised AI models deliver more accurate insights and enhanced operational efficiency.\\n\\nThe shift towards customised AI solutions is driven by the recognition that off-the-shelf tools often fall short of meeting the nuanced needs of each organisation. These tailored models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, seamlessly integrated with existing systems, and designed to process unique data sets that reflect the intricacies of each business. For instance, a retail company might leverage a custom AI model to analyse consumer behaviour and optimise inventory management, whilst a healthcare provider could develop a bespoke solution to predict patient outcomes and refine treatment plans.This level of personalisation not only ensures higher accuracy but also provides a significant competitive advantage in today's data-driven landscape.\\n\\n4. Small Language Models\\n------------------------\\n\\nSmall Language Models\\n\\nSmall Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as a formidable force in the realm of AI, offering a compelling alternative to their larger counterparts. These compact AI models, with parameter counts ranging from a few million to a few billion, are designed to process, understand and generate natural language content with remarkable efficiency. SLMs employ advanced techniques such as model compression, knowledge distillation and transfer learning to condense the broad capabilities of larger models into a more focused, domain-specific toolset.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of SLMs is their ability to operate in resource-constrained environments, making them ideal for edge devices and mobile applications. For instance, Granite 3.0 1B-A400M and Granite 3.0 3B-A800M boast total parameter counts of 1 billion and 3 billion respectively, yet their active parameter counts at inference are a mere 400 million and 800 million.\\n\\nThis reduction in parameters translates to decreased processing times and lower latency, allowing SLMs to respond swiftly to user queries. Moreover, their compact nature makes them more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective, as they consume less energy and require fewer computational resources compared to their larger counterparts.\\n\\n3.AI for workplace productivity\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nAI for workplace productivity\\n\\nAI is revolutionising workplace productivity, offering a plethora of tools designed to streamline tasks and enhance efficiency across various sectors. From automating mundane administrative duties to providing sophisticated data analysis, AI-powered solutions are transforming how businesses operate in the digital age.\\n\\nOne notable example is Notion AI, an intelligent feature integrated into the popular workspace platform. This innovative tool assists users in generating content, answering queries and autofilling tables within their Notion pages. By leveraging AI capabilities, Notion enables teams to brainstorm more effectively, draft documents with greater speed and manage projects with increased precision.\\n\\nSimilarly, Otter.ai has emerged as a game-changer in the realm of meeting productivity. This AI-powered assistant offers real-time transcription, speaker identification and audio-text synchronisation, allowing professionals to focus on discussions rather than note-taking. These advancements not only save time but also enhance the quality of work output, demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI in boosting workplace efficiency.\\n\\n2. Gen AI democratisation\\n-------------------------\\n\\nGen AI\\n\\nGen AI has emerged as a powerful force in democratising innovation, placing sophisticated tools in the hands of individuals across various sectors. This technological leap forward has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for creative and analytical endeavours, enabling a broader range of users to harness AI's capabilities without extensive technical expertise.\\n\\nThe impact of this democratisation is particularly evident in the business world, where Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be using Gen AI APIs and models in production environments, a stark increase from less than 5% in 2023.\\n\\nThis shift signifies a move towards more inclusive and efficient business practices, with AI tools being integrated into everyday applications. For instance, sales teams can now utilise AI-powered chatbots and proposal generators to streamline their operations, enhancing productivity without the need for extensive data science teams.\\n\\nHowever, this widespread adoption is not without its challenges. A Boston Consulting Group study revealed that over half of executives surveyed are actively discouraging the use of generative AI due to a lack of understanding, whilst 37% are in a state of experimentation without proper policies or controls in place.\\n\\n1. Multimodal AI\\n----------------\\n\\n![Image 4: Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fD9SiYSpiwE/hqdefault.jpg)\\n\\nMultimodal AI represents a significant leap forward in AI, combining various data types such as text, images, audio, and video to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Unlike traditional unimodal systems that rely on a single data type, multimodal AI integrates diverse inputs, enabling it to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and contextual awareness.\\n\\nAt its core, multimodal AI comprises three key components: the input module, fusion module, and output module. The input module consists of multiple unimodal neural networks, each handling a different data type. The fusion module then processes and aligns the information from each modality, employing techniques such as early fusion to concatenate raw data. Finally, the output module delivers results that are often richer and more nuanced than those produced by unimodal systems\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_Explore the latest edition of_[_AI Magazine_](https://aimagazine.com/magazines)_and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,_[_Tech & AI LIVE_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_._\\n\\n_Discover all our_[_upcoming events_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_and secure your tickets today._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_AI Magazine_ _is a_[_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)_brand_\\n\\nTags\\n----\\n\\n[Ai](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Ai)[Technology](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Technology)[Top 10](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Top%2010)\\n\\nGlobal Events Program\\n\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/original/56b0636423c3c19c8bae6799794d7e5a:1711177fd9997efefa2485128289204e/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025-dark-logo.png)\\n\\n[Join us in Singapore on November 4](https://technologymagazine.com/events/tech-and-ai-live/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025)Attend Now\\n\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/9e903a884b23ac5e51801f561ae2e97c:396c4e0243970d67716f10a1f9e1881f/01-cover-ai-may2025.jpg)![Image 7](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/ca43aa688cdfe32da87b5e020a382af2:f54805cdfedc8a8764c8bd0dcc83d8ee/01-cover-ai-mar2025.jpg)![Image 8](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/fa38760b56c6ad79a5cec622275cb943:65aa8a8a2856761ad616a73c794fef31/00-cover-ai-jan2025.jpg)\\n\\n[Read Now](https://aimagazine.com/magazine)\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n*   [Is ‘Zero Trust’ the Future of Data Centre Security?

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\n\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\n\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\n\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\n\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\n\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\n\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\n\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\n\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\n\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\n\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\n\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\n\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\n\\n### 4. AI Helps Improve Healthcare Outcomes\\n\\nOver the last year, in particular, AI has been incredibly transformative in the healthcare industry.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)  \\nSearch volume for “healthcare AI” has increased 426% over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)\\n\\n**Adoption among hospitals is surging — [90% of hospitals](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/90-of-hospitals-have-artificial-intelligence-strategies-in-place) have an AI strategy and 75% of hospital executives say AI initiatives are critical.**\\n\\nAI, along with machine learning, is [speeding up several processes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/02/16/ai-for-health-and-hope-how-machine-learning-is-being-used-in-hospitals/?sh=1765c88a55be) in hospitals. This includes tasks like scanning handwritten data into an online platform, recording audio from doctor-patient conversations and converting it to text notes, and identifying patients for research studies.\\n\\nThis technology is also becoming an essential tool in the midst of a hospital staffing crisis.\\n\\nIn 2021, hospital staff turnover [grew 6.4%](https://www.nsinursingsolutions.com/Documents/Library/NSI_National_Health_Care_Retention_Report.pdf) to stand at nearly 26%.\\n\\n***![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)  \\nHospital turnover in 2021 was nearly 8 points higher than in 2017.***\\n\\n![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)\\n\\nNearly [334,000 medical clinicians](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/finding-right-candidates-keeping-them-ai-aiding-healthcare-industry-meets) left the workforce in 2021 alone.\\n\\nImplementing AI solutions helps bear the brunt of this staffing shortage.\\n\\nIn one survey, 58% of hospital executives said AI was very or often effective in [improving operational performance](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-healthcare/).\\n\\nMany hospitals are turning to AI-powered staffing platforms like [DirectShifts](https://www.directshifts.com).\\n\\n***![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)  \\nThe DirectShifts platform utilizes AI to match job seekers with hospitals.***\\n\\n![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)\\n\\nThis platform uses AI to match clinicians with hospital job postings. The majority of these positions are per-diem, which are employees that hospitals may only need when the census is high.\\n\\nThere are currently more than 850,000 clinicians on the platform.\\n\\nSome hospitals are easing the burden placed on nurses by investing in AI systems that help monitor patients.\\n\\n[Ouva’s AI-based platform](https://www.ouva.co/) constantly analyzes patient behavior and potential risks.\\n\\n***![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)  \\nA view from Ouva’s dashboard.***\\n\\n![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)\\n\\nThe platform takes data from optical sensors and alerts nurses when high-risk patients have left their beds. It also monitors things like nurse visits, meal delivery, and arrival and discharge of patients.\\n\\nAI has the potential to impact the healthcare industry in numerous other ways, as well.\\n\\nDrug development, disease diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans are just a few ways AI might be put to work in the future.\\n\\nInvestors are paying attention to this sector, too.\\n\\nMore than [$1.6 billion](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjH59nO38_9AhVQnGoFHat-CgQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.crunchbase.com%2Fhealth-wellness-biotech%2Fnested-cancer-treatment%2F&usg=AOvVaw3T5nvL1uRtmCpuUiV6FdWA) was invested in drug discovery startups in 2022.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)  \\nSearch volume for “pharmaceutical AI” has grown 300% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)\\n\\nIn one example, Microsoft continues to invest in healthcare AI.\\n\\nThe tech giant has partnered with [Paige](https://paige.ai) in order to apply AI technology to [improve cancer diagnosis](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005266/en/Paige-Collaborates-with-Microsoft-to-Transform-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-with-the-Use-of-Pathology-AI) and patient care.\\n\\nPaige was the first company to receive FDA approval for using AI in digital pathology.\\n\\n***![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)  \\n[Paige’s AI tool](https://paige.ai/) helps pathologists identify regions that are likely to harbor cancer.***\\n\\n![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)\\n\\n### 5.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

individuals Microsoft helped train and certify over the past year has been updated to 23 million and includes initiatives across Microsoft._\\n\\nIn 2024, generative AI emerged as a key driver for

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution.

Its extensive library of algorithms supports a wide array of applications, including facial recognition, object detection and motion tracking. The longevity and versatility of OpenCV underscore the enduring impact of open source AI initiatives. Another prominent player in the open source AI landscape is OpenNN, a neural network library that excels in predictive analytics. Developed by Artelnics, OpenNN has found applications in customer intelligence and industry-specific analytics, demonstrating the practical value of open source AI in business contexts.\\n\\n7. Agentic AI\\n-------------\\n\\nAgentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, offering a level of autonomy and decision-making capability that sets it apart from traditional AI systems. This advanced form of AI is designed to operate independently, making decisions and adapting to changing environments with minimal human intervention. Unlike its predecessors, agentic AI can analyse complex situations, formulate strategies and execute multi-step tasks to achieve predefined goals. At its core, agentic AI employs sophisticated algorithms that enable it to understand and interpret natural language instructions, develop action plans and adjust its approach based on real-time feedback.\\n\\nThis adaptability allows it to optimise workflows, enhance customer service experiences and streamline operations across various industries. For instance, in financial services, agentic AI excels at fraud detection by analysing vast amounts of data and autonomously initiating resolution workflows when issues are identified. Its ability to learn from interactions and improve over time positions agentic AI as a powerful tool for enterprises seeking to boost efficiency and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.\\n\\n6.AI in scientific research\\n---------------------------\\n\\nAI in scientific research\\n\\nAI is rapidly transforming scientific research across numerous disciplines, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, hypothesis generation, and experimental design.

These advancements not only save time but also enhance the quality of work output, demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI in boosting workplace efficiency.\\n\\n2. Gen AI democratisation\\n-------------------------\\n\\nGen AI\\n\\nGen AI has emerged as a powerful force in democratising innovation, placing sophisticated tools in the hands of individuals across various sectors. This technological leap forward has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for creative and analytical endeavours, enabling a broader range of users to harness AI's capabilities without extensive technical expertise.\\n\\nThe impact of this democratisation is particularly evident in the business world, where Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be using Gen AI APIs and models in production environments, a stark increase from less than 5% in 2023.\\n\\nThis shift signifies a move towards more inclusive and efficient business practices, with AI tools being integrated into everyday applications. For instance, sales teams can now utilise AI-powered chatbots and proposal generators to streamline their operations, enhancing productivity without the need for extensive data science teams.\\n\\nHowever, this widespread adoption is not without its challenges. A Boston Consulting Group study revealed that over half of executives surveyed are actively discouraging the use of generative AI due to a lack of understanding, whilst 37% are in a state of experimentation without proper policies or controls in place.\\n\\n1. Multimodal AI\\n----------------\\n\\n![Image 4: Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fD9SiYSpiwE/hqdefault.jpg)\\n\\nMultimodal AI represents a significant leap forward in AI, combining various data types such as text, images, audio, and video to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Unlike traditional unimodal systems that rely on a single data type, multimodal AI integrates diverse inputs, enabling it to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and contextual awareness.\\n\\nAt its core, multimodal AI comprises three key components: the input module, fusion module, and output module. The input module consists of multiple unimodal neural networks, each handling a different data type. The fusion module then processes and aligns the information from each modality, employing techniques such as early fusion to concatenate raw data. Finally, the output module delivers results that are often richer and more nuanced than those produced by unimodal systems\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_Explore the latest edition of_[_AI Magazine_](https://aimagazine.com/magazines)_and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,_[_Tech & AI LIVE_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_._\\n\\n_Discover all our_[_upcoming events_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_and secure your tickets today._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_AI Magazine_ _is a_[_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)_brand_\\n\\nTags\\n----\\n\\n[Ai](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Ai)[Technology](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Technology)[Top 10](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Top%2010)\\n\\nGlobal Events Program\\n\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/original/56b0636423c3c19c8bae6799794d7e5a:1711177fd9997efefa2485128289204e/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025-dark-logo.png)\\n\\n[Join us in Singapore on November 4](https://technologymagazine.com/events/tech-and-ai-live/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025)Attend Now\\n\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/9e903a884b23ac5e51801f561ae2e97c:396c4e0243970d67716f10a1f9e1881f/01-cover-ai-may2025.jpg)![Image 7](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/ca43aa688cdfe32da87b5e020a382af2:f54805cdfedc8a8764c8bd0dcc83d8ee/01-cover-ai-mar2025.jpg)![Image 8](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/fa38760b56c6ad79a5cec622275cb943:65aa8a8a2856761ad616a73c794fef31/00-cover-ai-jan2025.jpg)\\n\\n[Read Now](https://aimagazine.com/magazine)\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n*   [Is ‘Zero Trust’ the Future of Data Centre Security?

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\n\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\n\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\n\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\n\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\n\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\n\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\n\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\n\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\n\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\n\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\n\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\n\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\n\\n### 4. AI Helps Improve Healthcare Outcomes\\n\\nOver the last year, in particular, AI has been incredibly transformative in the healthcare industry.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)  \\nSearch volume for “healthcare AI” has increased 426% over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)\\n\\n**Adoption among hospitals is surging — [90% of hospitals](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/90-of-hospitals-have-artificial-intelligence-strategies-in-place) have an AI strategy and 75% of hospital executives say AI initiatives are critical.**\\n\\nAI, along with machine learning, is [speeding up several processes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/02/16/ai-for-health-and-hope-how-machine-learning-is-being-used-in-hospitals/?sh=1765c88a55be) in hospitals. This includes tasks like scanning handwritten data into an online platform, recording audio from doctor-patient conversations and converting it to text notes, and identifying patients for research studies.\\n\\nThis technology is also becoming an essential tool in the midst of a hospital staffing crisis.\\n\\nIn 2021, hospital staff turnover [grew 6.4%](https://www.nsinursingsolutions.com/Documents/Library/NSI_National_Health_Care_Retention_Report.pdf) to stand at nearly 26%.\\n\\n***![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)  \\nHospital turnover in 2021 was nearly 8 points higher than in 2017.***\\n\\n![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)\\n\\nNearly [334,000 medical clinicians](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/finding-right-candidates-keeping-them-ai-aiding-healthcare-industry-meets) left the workforce in 2021 alone.\\n\\nImplementing AI solutions helps bear the brunt of this staffing shortage.\\n\\nIn one survey, 58% of hospital executives said AI was very or often effective in [improving operational performance](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-healthcare/).\\n\\nMany hospitals are turning to AI-powered staffing platforms like [DirectShifts](https://www.directshifts.com).\\n\\n***![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)  \\nThe DirectShifts platform utilizes AI to match job seekers with hospitals.***\\n\\n![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)\\n\\nThis platform uses AI to match clinicians with hospital job postings. The majority of these positions are per-diem, which are employees that hospitals may only need when the census is high.\\n\\nThere are currently more than 850,000 clinicians on the platform.\\n\\nSome hospitals are easing the burden placed on nurses by investing in AI systems that help monitor patients.\\n\\n[Ouva’s AI-based platform](https://www.ouva.co/) constantly analyzes patient behavior and potential risks.\\n\\n***![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)  \\nA view from Ouva’s dashboard.***\\n\\n![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)\\n\\nThe platform takes data from optical sensors and alerts nurses when high-risk patients have left their beds. It also monitors things like nurse visits, meal delivery, and arrival and discharge of patients.\\n\\nAI has the potential to impact the healthcare industry in numerous other ways, as well.\\n\\nDrug development, disease diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans are just a few ways AI might be put to work in the future.\\n\\nInvestors are paying attention to this sector, too.\\n\\nMore than [$1.6 billion](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjH59nO38_9AhVQnGoFHat-CgQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.crunchbase.com%2Fhealth-wellness-biotech%2Fnested-cancer-treatment%2F&usg=AOvVaw3T5nvL1uRtmCpuUiV6FdWA) was invested in drug discovery startups in 2022.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)  \\nSearch volume for “pharmaceutical AI” has grown 300% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)\\n\\nIn one example, Microsoft continues to invest in healthcare AI.\\n\\nThe tech giant has partnered with [Paige](https://paige.ai) in order to apply AI technology to [improve cancer diagnosis](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005266/en/Paige-Collaborates-with-Microsoft-to-Transform-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-with-the-Use-of-Pathology-AI) and patient care.\\n\\nPaige was the first company to receive FDA approval for using AI in digital pathology.\\n\\n***![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)  \\n[Paige’s AI tool](https://paige.ai/) helps pathologists identify regions that are likely to harbor cancer.***\\n\\n![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)\\n\\n### 5.

Computer Vision Boosts Efficiency Across Industries\\n\\n[Computer vision](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/computer-vision.html) is a segment of AI that allows computers to interpret information from images and videos, and act on that information.\\n\\nToday’s computer vision systems are more accurate than humans and react quicker than humans.\\n\\nFor example, computer vision [boosts defect detection in manufacturing by 90%](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/documents/infographics/2019/en-computer-vision-110208.pdf).\\n\\nIt can be used for everything from monitoring pipelines and crops to identifying counterfeit money and areas of concern in cancer patients.\\n\\n***![computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/2Bp7KdBJQ4yqumhMKbkm)  \\nComputer vision technology has far-reaching implications.***\\n\\n![computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/2Bp7KdBJQ4yqumhMKbkm)\\n\\nWhile the concept of computer vision has been around since the 1950s, the advent of deep learning technology is enabling computer vision to be used in a wide range of applications that simply weren't possible in previous years.\\n\\nIn one survey, [nearly 30% of business leaders](https://www.shutterstock.com/developers/whitepaper-data-quality-for-trustworthy-computer-vision?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=computer-vision-whitepaper-2022&utm_campaignid=7013Z000002w6FhQAI) said they’ve seen a growing demand for computer vision solutions. More than half of them were most excited about object tracking and identification through computer vision.\\n\\nComputer vision is one way in which manufacturers are jumping into the [Industry 4.0 trend](https://voxel51.com/blog/how-computer-vision-is-changing-manufacturing-in-2023/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ujrdWXKoRNUgMpLudKKA)  \\nSearch interest for “AI in manufacturing” is up 480% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ujrdWXKoRNUgMpLudKKA)\\n\\nThis is an industry that’s suffering from huge staffing shortages. Up to [7.9 million manufacturing jobs](https://www.kornferry.com/content/dam/kornferry/docs/pdfs/KF-Future-of-Work-Talent-Crunch-Report.pdf) will go unfilled by 2030, resulting in unrealized revenue totaling $607.14 billion.\\n\\n***![future-of-work-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VnpO60fJR7S96Gd23fRL)  \\nThe shortage of workers in manufacturing is expected to get much worse in the coming years.***\\n\\n![future-of-work-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VnpO60fJR7S96Gd23fRL)\\n\\nBy using computer vision, manufacturers are increasing the efficiency and performance of their facilities, as well as reducing staffing numbers.\\n\\n[Detecting anomalies](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/business-operations-room-blog/2022/computer-vision-manufacturing-ai.html) is one important role of computer vision in manufacturing.\\n\\nA computer vision system can track every step of the production process. If a step is missed or something is done out of order, an alarm is set off.\\n\\nIn addition, the system knows how long a production cycle should take and can detect faults if the cycle runs too fast.\\n\\nFinally, when a faulty product is detected, workers can look up the item by its serial number to watch exactly what happened during the manufacturing process.\\n\\n[Instrumental](https://instrumental.com/) offers an AI/computer vision system that provides issue discovery and quality monitoring for electronics manufacturers. The system also performs end-to-end failure analysis.\\n\\n***![instrumental-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/qpY4wu4TFCRHjKWijFgm)  \\nInstrumental’s AI system allows manufacturers to find problems and fix them fast.***\\n\\n![instrumental-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/qpY4wu4TFCRHjKWijFgm)\\n\\nAccording to the company, their system results in a 43% reduction in rework and a 3x gain in product engineering efficiency.\\n\\nCompanies that install the system see a positive ROI in less than 60 days, they say.\\n\\nComputer vision is also being deployed in response to natural disasters and climate change issues.\\n\\nOne California startup, aptly named [Rain](https://www.rain.aero/), is using computer vision to fight wildfires.\\n\\n***![rain-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/FZmlGQoURbKeBYTGX2JY)  \\nRain’s aircraft is able to stay in the air for over an hour.***\\n\\n![rain-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/FZmlGQoURbKeBYTGX2JY)\\n\\nTheir product is an [unmanned autonomous helicopter](https://verticalmag.com/press-releases/rain-industries-announces-autonomous-firefighting-helicopter/) that uses AI and computer vision to deliver water to a wildfire before it grows out of control.\\n\\nThe company’s idea is to put these helicopters in high-risk areas that aren’t staffed by humans 24/7. If a wildfire broke out, the helicopter could be immediately deployed by a pilot at a remote location.\\n\\nThe project will be tested this year on real fires in California and the company projects they’ll build [200 helicopter stations](https://qz.com/firetech-forest-wildfire-startup-technology-1850205150) there.\\n\\nIn addition, a team at the University of Cambridge recently developed a [computer vision system](https://www.zmescience.com/science/this-new-app-can-measure-trees-much-faster-than-manual-methods/) that allows scientists to monitor forests and carbon sequestration from their smartphones.\\n\\n***![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)  \\nThe computer vision system developed by the University of Cambridge utilizes LiDAR sensors.***\\n\\n![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)\\n\\nThe error rate is 8%, which is lower than the error rate occurring when humans complete the task.\\n\\nAt the same time as it’s being deployed in a wide variety of industries, the technology of computer vision itself is being revolutionized.\\n\\nToday’s computer vision works by taking an image or series of images in still frames. Then the still frames are analyzed by the computer.\\n\\nHowever, one company is imagining computer vision that doesn’t need still frames.\\n\\n[Ubicept](https://www.ubicept.com/), a company formed in 2021, has developed computer vision that can [measure individual photons](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/10/ubicept-computer-vision/) instead of looking at still frames.\\n\\nThat process is faster and more reliable than traditional computer vision.\\n\\nIt’s especially beneficial for situations in which the camera needs to capture objects moving fast or objects in low light.\\n\\n***![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)  \\nUbicept’s [computer vision technology](https://www.ubicept.com/blog/viva-las-vegas) excels in low light and fast motion, two areas in which traditional computer vision falls short.***\\n\\n![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)\\n\\n### 7. Retailers Deploy AI In-Store and Online\\n\\nThe retail sector is one that could potentially reap huge benefits from the use of AI.\\n\\nPredictions show the market for AI in retail growing at a [CAGR of more than 30%](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-retail-market-101968) through 2028. The market will hit $31.18 billion that year, according to estimates.\\n\\nAs of 2024, [40% of retailers are already using AI in some form](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1400301/ai-mv-and-cv-use-retail/).\\n\\nAnd the use of AI is continuing to grow.\\n\\nIn the Retail Technology Study, [40% of retail organizations](https://risnews.com/retail-tech-study-2022?from=gate) said shopper tracking capability was going to be one of their top tech investments within the next two years.\\n\\nLocation-based marketing, digital devices, and computer vision also made the list with more than one-third of retailers saying they’ll focus on those tech solutions in the next two years.\\n\\n***![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)  \\nRetail leaders are planning to invest heavily in AI in the next two years.***\\n\\n![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)\\n\\nOne of the most obvious uses of [AI in retail](https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-implement-ai-self-checkout-in-retail-if-you-are-not-amazon) is at checkout.\\n\\nStores like Amazon Go track customers through the store via computer vision. When a person puts an item in a physical cart, the computer vision catches which product it is and adds it to a virtual cart of sorts. When the person leaves the store, their digital wallet is charged accordingly.\\n\\nRetailers are also using [AI for inventory management](https://addepto.com/blog/ai-in-inventory-management/).\\n\\nAI systems can monitor stock levels in the warehouse and on shelves. When stock is running low, the system can automatically notify the proper channels and decrease the time it takes to replenish the product supply.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)  \\nSearch volume for “warehouse automation” has increased by 103% over the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)\\n\\nMcKinsey reports that businesses that adopt [AI-enabled supply chains](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution) see a 15% improvement in logistics costs and a 35% improvement in inventory levels.\\n\\nAI also enables retailers to utilize dynamic pricing.\\n\\nWith data from the retailer, competitors, and customers, AI can be used to [adjust pricing in real time](https://segwitz.com/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-retail-industry/) and maximize profits.\\n\\nRetailers that use electronic shelf labels and AI-enabled dynamic pricing have the potential to [increase profit by 33%](https://revionics.com/blog/electronic-shelf-labels-price-optimization).\\n\\nOne of the most recent developments for retailers is generative AI.\\n\\nFor instance, [Shopify Magic](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-product-descriptions) was released in early 2023 as a tool that will write ecommerce product descriptions for retailers.\\n\\n***![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)  \\nShopify Magic enables retailers to create product descriptions in seconds.***\\n\\n![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)\\n\\nShopify says they’ll be adding more tools with AI in the near future.\\n\\nRetailers are also utilizing generative AI to create in-store displays.\\n\\nBy inserting a few prompts into a program like DALL-E, retailers can come up with a visual concept and merchandising imagery.\\n\\nOne retailer said her team typically spends a week brainstorming and [creating imagery for a new in-store design](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/in-store-innovation/how-store-design-teams-are-unlocking-tangible-value-from-ai-platforms).\\n\\nWith AI, they were able to do it in just eight hours.\\n\\n***![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)  \\nAn example of an AI-generated concept for a luxury fashion store.***\\n\\n![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)\\n\\nApparel companies are also using generative AI to create hundreds of recommended outfit combinations that appear on their websites and apps.\\n\\nBy working with the company [Stylitics](https://stylitics.com/), Puma was able to [increase conversions by 235%](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/inventory-merchandising/puma-using-ai-powered-styling-brainstorm-with-customers-increase-aov-stylitics-visual-merchandising) and session duration by 334%.\\n\\n***![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)  \\nStylitics’ AI-powered solution puts together outfit combinations and replaces outfit pieces as they go out of stock.***\\n\\n![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)\\n\\n### 8. Increasing Potential for AI Risks and Regulations\\n\\nAs AI adoption has increased, the level of risk mitigation has remained the same.\\n\\nThis means that many enterprises aren’t paying attention to the risks associated with AI.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/WrGBbkv4TXatpu5TEUga)  \\nSearch volume for “AI risks” is up more than 700% since 2019.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/WrGBbkv4TXatpu5TEUga)\\n\\nWhen looking at the past three years, a survey from McKinsey showed no substantial increase in the amount of attention companies are giving any [AI-related risks](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#review).

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.\\\\xa0 AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers. \\\\xa0Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like \\\\xa0[OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions.\\\\xa0These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced\\\\xa0[new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.

number of individuals Microsoft helped train and certify over the past year has been updated to 23 million and includes initiatives across Microsoft._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, generative AI emerged

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality.

of 2024\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI Magazine examines the top 10 AI trends of 2024 to understand the developments of this year and see what could be on the agenda for 2025\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs we enter 2025, AI continues to reshape industries and redefine the boundaries of technological innovation. The rapid evolution of AI has ushered in a new era of digital transformation, with generative AI leading the charge. Investment in this groundbreaking technology is projected by [PWC](https://aimagazine.com/articles/examining-the-big-openai-and-pwc-enterprise-deal) to contribute a staggering US$15.7tn to the global economy in 2030,underscoring its pivotal role in shaping the future of business and society.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom revolutionising [healthcare](https://aimagazine.com/ai-applications/alphafold-3-google-deepmind-seeks-to-transform-healthcare) with AI-driven diagnostics to transforming [financial services](https://aimagazine.com/articles/ey-finance-leaders-turn-to-ai-to-solve-esg-data-problems) with intelligent algorithms, the impact of AI is far-reaching and profound.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, this technological leap forward also brings new challenges, particularly in the realms of ethics, regulation, and data security.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn light of this, AI Magazine presents a comprehensive list of the top 10 AI trends of 2024 to understand the AI developments of this year and gain a glimpse of what could be in store for 2025.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. AI governance and ethics\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI governance and ethics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI governance and ethics have become paramount concerns as artificial intelligence technologies continue to reshape our world. The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted by 193 countries in 2021, stands as a cornerstone in this field. This comprehensive framework emphasises four core values: respect for human rights, fostering just societies, environmental well-being, and diversity and inclusiveness. It interprets AI broadly, recognising the rapid pace of technological change and the need for future-proof policies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe recommendation outlines eleven key areas for policy actions, moving beyond high-level principles to practical strategies. These include sustainability, fairness, technical safety, accountability, explainability, and data stewardship. To support the implementation of these principles, UNESCO has established the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory. This platform serves as a vital resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, and civil society, offering country profiles, expert insights, and good practices in AI ethics and governance. The observatory\\\\'s AI Ethics and Governance Lab gathers contributions, research, and toolkits to address pressing challenges in responsible AI innovation, standards, and institutional capacities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9.AI talent demand\\\\\\\\n------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI talent demand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe demand for AI talent has skyrocketed in recent years, with job postings incorporating AI skills as a requirement surging by 130% over the last two years. This trend is particularly evident in the field of generative AI, where roles have seen an unprecedented 1,300% increase in demand. The surge reflects the critical importance of AI expertise in today\\\\'s rapidly evolving tech landscape, with machine learning and data science roles growing by 80% and 250%, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis dramatic shift in the job market has led to a significant skills shortage, with the International Data Corporation predicting that over 90% of companies will face IT skills shortages by 2026. In response, organisations are increasingly looking beyond traditional talent pools, with a 31% increase in demand for specialised skills across borders. This global approach to talent acquisition is reshaping recruitment strategies, as companies seek to build teams with the specialised skills needed to develop and implement AI-driven solutions. The trend towards skills-based hiring is further emphasised by the fact that 80% of companies are now prioritising becoming skills-based organisations, with a particular focus on AI and related technologies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. Open source AI\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen Source AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen source AI has emerged as a powerful force in the realm of technology, fostering collaboration and innovation on a global scale.

The transparency inherent in open source AI has led to significant advancements in various fields, from natural language processing to computer vision.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most notable examples of open source AI is OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library. Launched in 1999 as part of an Intel research project, OpenCV has since become a cornerstone in the computer vision community. Its extensive library of algorithms supports a wide array of applications, including facial recognition, object detection and motion tracking. The longevity and versatility of OpenCV underscore the enduring impact of open source AI initiatives. Another prominent player in the open source AI landscape is OpenNN, a neural network library that excels in predictive analytics. Developed by Artelnics, OpenNN has found applications in customer intelligence and industry-specific analytics, demonstrating the practical value of open source AI in business contexts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. Agentic AI\\\\\\\\n-------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAgentic AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAgentic AI represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, offering a level of autonomy and decision-making capability that sets it apart from traditional AI systems. This advanced form of AI is designed to operate independently, making decisions and adapting to changing environments with minimal human intervention. Unlike its predecessors, agentic AI can analyse complex situations, formulate strategies and execute multi-step tasks to achieve predefined goals. At its core, agentic AI employs sophisticated algorithms that enable it to understand and interpret natural language instructions, develop action plans and adjust its approach based on real-time feedback.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis adaptability allows it to optimise workflows, enhance customer service experiences and streamline operations across various industries. For instance, in financial services, agentic AI excels at fraud detection by analysing vast amounts of data and autonomously initiating resolution workflows when issues are identified. Its ability to learn from interactions and improve over time positions agentic AI as a powerful tool for enterprises seeking to boost efficiency and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6.AI in scientific research\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI in scientific research\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is rapidly transforming scientific research across numerous disciplines, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, hypothesis generation, and experimental design.

Moreover, AI is fostering interdisciplinary research by integrating data and methodologies from different scientific fields, leading to innovative solutions for complex problems such as climate change and its socioeconomic impacts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.Customisable AI\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomisable AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomisable AI models have emerged as a powerful tool for businesses seeking to harness the full potential of AI. Unlike generic solutions, these bespoke models are tailored to address specific challenges and optimise performance in targeted areas. By aligning closely with a company\\\\'s unique data sets and objectives, customised AI models deliver more accurate insights and enhanced operational efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe shift towards customised AI solutions is driven by the recognition that off-the-shelf tools often fall short of meeting the nuanced needs of each organisation. These tailored models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, seamlessly integrated with existing systems, and designed to process unique data sets that reflect the intricacies of each business. For instance, a retail company might leverage a custom AI model to analyse consumer behaviour and optimise inventory management, whilst a healthcare provider could develop a bespoke solution to predict patient outcomes and refine treatment plans.This level of personalisation not only ensures higher accuracy but also provides a significant competitive advantage in today\\\\'s data-driven landscape.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Small Language Models\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmall Language Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmall Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as a formidable force in the realm of AI, offering a compelling alternative to their larger counterparts. These compact AI models, with parameter counts ranging from a few million to a few billion, are designed to process, understand and generate natural language content with remarkable efficiency. SLMs employ advanced techniques such as model compression, knowledge distillation and transfer learning to condense the broad capabilities of larger models into a more focused, domain-specific toolset.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the key advantages of SLMs is their ability to operate in resource-constrained environments, making them ideal for edge devices and mobile applications. For instance, Granite 3.0 1B-A400M and Granite 3.0 3B-A800M boast total parameter counts of 1 billion and 3 billion respectively, yet their active parameter counts at inference are a mere 400 million and 800 million.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis reduction in parameters translates to decreased processing times and lower latency, allowing SLMs to respond swiftly to user queries. Moreover, their compact nature makes them more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective, as they consume less energy and require fewer computational resources compared to their larger counterparts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.AI for workplace productivity\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI for workplace productivity\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is revolutionising workplace productivity, offering a plethora of tools designed to streamline tasks and enhance efficiency across various sectors. From automating mundane administrative duties to providing sophisticated data analysis, AI-powered solutions are transforming how businesses operate in the digital age.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne notable example is Notion AI, an intelligent feature integrated into the popular workspace platform. This innovative tool assists users in generating content, answering queries and autofilling tables within their Notion pages. By leveraging AI capabilities, Notion enables teams to brainstorm more effectively, draft documents with greater speed and manage projects with increased precision.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, Otter.ai has emerged as a game-changer in the realm of meeting productivity. This AI-powered assistant offers real-time transcription, speaker identification and audio-text synchronisation, allowing professionals to focus on discussions rather than note-taking. These advancements not only save time but also enhance the quality of work output, demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI in boosting workplace efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Gen AI democratisation\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGen AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGen AI has emerged as a powerful force in democratising innovation, placing sophisticated tools in the hands of individuals across various sectors. This technological leap forward has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for creative and analytical endeavours, enabling a broader range of users to harness AI\\\\'s capabilities without extensive technical expertise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe impact of this democratisation is particularly evident in the business world, where Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be using Gen AI APIs and models in production environments, a stark increase from less than 5% in 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shift signifies a move towards more inclusive and efficient business practices, with AI tools being integrated into everyday applications. For instance, sales teams can now utilise AI-powered chatbots and proposal generators to streamline their operations, enhancing productivity without the need for extensive data science teams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, this widespread adoption is not without its challenges. A Boston Consulting Group study revealed that over half of executives surveyed are actively discouraging the use of generative AI due to a lack of understanding, whilst 37% are in a state of experimentation without proper policies or controls in place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Multimodal AI\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4: Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fD9SiYSpiwE/hqdefault.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultimodal AI represents a significant leap forward in AI, combining various data types such as text, images, audio, and video to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Unlike traditional unimodal systems that rely on a single data type, multimodal AI integrates diverse inputs, enabling it to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and contextual awareness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt its core, multimodal AI comprises three key components: the input module, fusion module, and output module. The input module consists of multiple unimodal neural networks, each handling a different data type. The fusion module then processes and aligns the information from each modality, employing techniques such as early fusion to concatenate raw data. Finally, the output module delivers results that are often richer and more nuanced than those produced by unimodal systems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Explore the latest edition of_[_AI Magazine_](https://aimagazine.com/magazines)_and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,_[_Tech & AI LIVE_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Discover all our_[_upcoming events_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_and secure your tickets today._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_AI Magazine_ _is a_[_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)_brand_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTags\\\\\\\\n----\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Ai](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Ai)[Technology](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Technology)[Top 10](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Top%2010)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGlobal Events Program\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/original/56b0636423c3c19c8bae6799794d7e5a:1711177fd9997efefa2485128289204e/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025-dark-logo.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Join us in Singapore on November 4](https://technologymagazine.com/events/tech-and-ai-live/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025)Attend Now\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/9e903a884b23ac5e51801f561ae2e97c:396c4e0243970d67716f10a1f9e1881f/01-cover-ai-may2025.jpg)![Image 7](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/ca43aa688cdfe32da87b5e020a382af2:f54805cdfedc8a8764c8bd0dcc83d8ee/01-cover-ai-mar2025.jpg)![Image 8](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/fa38760b56c6ad79a5cec622275cb943:65aa8a8a2856761ad616a73c794fef31/00-cover-ai-jan2025.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Read Now](https://aimagazine.com/magazine)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelated Content\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   [Is ‘Zero Trust’ the Future of Data Centre Security?

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google\\\\'s all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\\\\\\\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI tools that use\\\\xa0[large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(And potentially disrupt Google\\\\'s [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\\\\\\\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal\\\\xa0or find a car to buy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of\\\\xa0[generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\\\\\\\\\"10 blue links\\\\\\\\\\\" with AI answers.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, \\\\\\\\\\\"AI search engine\\\\\\\\\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for \\\\\\\\\\\"Perplexity AI\\\\\\\\\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPerplexity has raised\\\\xa0[$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\\\\\\\\\"AI Overviews\\\\\\\\\\\" to many users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle\\\\'s AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd in the case of Google\\\\'s AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles\\\\xa0to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\\\\\\\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, what is NLP?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\'s basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\\\\\\\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\\\\\\\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 4.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.\\\\xa0 AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers. \\\\xa0Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like \\\\xa0[OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions.\\\\xa0These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced\\\\xa0[new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine,\\\\xa0improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\\\\\\\n---------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelated Posts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\\\\\\\\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to\\\\xa0automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\\\\\\\\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\\\\\\\\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided\\\\xa0 Last year, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\\\\\\\\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\\\\\\\\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTula Masterman\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubscribe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\\\\\\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\\\\\\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\\\\\\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\\\\\\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\\\\\\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\\\\\\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\\\\\\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases. In the next 24 months, a greater focus will be placed on functional and industry use cases.\\\\\\\\n*   The top barrier when implementing AI is the lack of both technical and day-to-day AI skills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### **Learn how to fuel your AI journey**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIDC’s study, which included more than 4,000 business leaders and AI decision-makers around the world, also identifies the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI. As businesses integrate new solutions, they navigate important considerations such as data privacy, responsible use and the need for investment in both technology and skills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo matter where you are in your cloud and AI transformation journey, Microsoft can help.

Retailers Deploy AI In-Store and Online\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe retail sector is one that could potentially reap huge benefits from the use of AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPredictions show the market for AI in retail growing at a [CAGR of more than 30%](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-retail-market-101968) through 2028. The market will hit $31.18 billion that year, according to estimates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs of 2024, [40% of retailers are already using AI in some form](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1400301/ai-mv-and-cv-use-retail/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd the use of AI is continuing to grow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the Retail Technology Study,\\\\xa0[40% of retail organizations](https://risnews.com/retail-tech-study-2022?from=gate) said shopper tracking capability was going to be one of their top tech investments within the next two years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLocation-based marketing, digital devices, and computer vision also made the list with more than one-third of retailers saying they’ll focus on those tech solutions in the next two years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)  \\\\\\\\nRetail leaders are planning to invest heavily in AI in the next two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most obvious uses of [AI in retail](https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-implement-ai-self-checkout-in-retail-if-you-are-not-amazon) is at checkout.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStores like Amazon Go track customers through the store via computer vision. When a person puts an item in a physical cart, the computer vision catches which product it is and adds it to a virtual cart of sorts. When the person leaves the store, their digital wallet is charged accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRetailers are also using [AI for inventory management](https://addepto.com/blog/ai-in-inventory-management/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI systems can monitor stock levels in the warehouse and on shelves. When stock is running low, the system can automatically notify the proper channels and decrease the time it takes to replenish the product supply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “warehouse automation” has increased by 103% over the past 5 years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMcKinsey reports that businesses that adopt [AI-enabled supply chains](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution) see a 15% improvement in logistics costs and a 35% improvement in inventory levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI also enables retailers to utilize dynamic pricing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith data from the retailer, competitors, and customers, AI can be used to [adjust pricing in real time](https://segwitz.com/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-retail-industry/) and maximize profits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRetailers that use electronic shelf labels and AI-enabled dynamic pricing have the potential to [increase profit by 33%](https://revionics.com/blog/electronic-shelf-labels-price-optimization).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most recent developments for retailers is generative AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, [Shopify Magic](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-product-descriptions) was released in early 2023 as a tool that will write ecommerce product descriptions for retailers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)  \\\\\\\\nShopify Magic enables retailers to create product descriptions in seconds.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShopify says they’ll be adding more tools with AI in the near future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRetailers are also utilizing generative AI to create in-store displays.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy inserting a few prompts into a program like DALL-E, retailers can come up with a visual concept and merchandising imagery.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne retailer said her team typically spends a week brainstorming and [creating imagery for a new in-store design](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/in-store-innovation/how-store-design-teams-are-unlocking-tangible-value-from-ai-platforms).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI, they were able to do it in just eight hours.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)  \\\\\\\\nAn example of an AI-generated concept for a luxury fashion store.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nApparel companies are also using generative AI to create hundreds of recommended outfit combinations that appear on their websites and apps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy working with the company [Stylitics](https://stylitics.com/), Puma was able to [increase conversions by 235%](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/inventory-merchandising/puma-using-ai-powered-styling-brainstorm-with-customers-increase-aov-stylitics-visual-merchandising) and session duration by 334%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)  \\\\\\\\nStylitics’ AI-powered solution puts together outfit combinations and replaces outfit pieces as they go out of stock.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 8. Increasing Potential for AI Risks and Regulations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs AI adoption has increased, the level of risk mitigation has remained the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that many enterprises aren’t paying attention to the risks associated with AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/WrGBbkv4TXatpu5TEUga)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “AI risks” is up more than 700% since 2019.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/WrGBbkv4TXatpu5TEUga)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen looking at the past three years, a survey from McKinsey showed no substantial increase in the amount of attention companies are giving any [AI-related risks](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#review). This includes cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, privacy, and explainability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![mckinsey-state-of-ai-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/zEeklCxqSVax2XeuWNaP)  \\\\\\\\nMcKinsey called the lack of focus on AI risks “concerning.”***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![mckinsey-state-of-ai-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/zEeklCxqSVax2XeuWNaP)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe list of [potential risks](https://ai100.stanford.edu/2021-report/standing-questions-and-responses/sq10-what-are-most-pressing-dangers-ai) is long — and it keeps growing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Wharton School created an extensive paper outlining [the risks of using AI in business](https://aiab.wharton.upenn.edu/research/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/). Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven\\\\'t been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\\\\\\\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\\\\\\\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\\\\\\\nThe\\\\xa0[AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen. In the coming years, the vulnerabilities of AI may be exposed, and governments, agencies, and consumers will have to decide how to balance the risks and benefits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![newsletter banner](https://explodingtopics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/trends-database-blog-cta.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Reveal More Competitor Secrets for Free\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShare\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNewsletter Signup\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy clicking “Subscribe” you agree to Semrush Privacy Policy and consent to Semrush using your contact data for newsletter purposes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWritten By\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:120,height:120/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\\\\\\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:64,height:64/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJosh Howarth\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJosh is the Co-Founder and CTO of Exploding Topics.\\\\\\\\nJosh has led Exploding Topics product development from the first line of co...

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.\\\\xa0 AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers. \\\\xa0Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like \\\\xa0[OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions.\\\\xa0These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced\\\\xa0[new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements.

number of individuals Microsoft helped train and certify over the past year has been updated to 23 million and includes initiatives across Microsoft._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024, generative AI emerged as a key driver for business outcomes across every industry. Already this new generation of AI is **[having an incredible impact](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/aka.ms/AIcustomersBlog___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjI0ZmFhZWY0OGM5YjcwMTU4OWNlY2JmYmNjZTI4MGZjOjY6MjI2YzoyYzY5NTMwNmZmNTM4YmZiYTIzOGE2ZDdhMjU3N2JjYWNhYWMwMDgyZDUwYmIxMjI2YmM1YTUwZjVmNThkNzMwOnA6RjpG)**on our world — yet companies and industries are just scratching the surface of what’s possible as they continue to develop new use cases across every role and function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo help guide organizations on their AI transformation journey, Microsoft recently commissioned a new study through IDC, [**The Business Opportunity of AI**](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG). IDC’s findings show that when organizations truly commit to and invest in AI, the return on investment (ROI) potential grows significantly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[![Image 3: A graphic showing the IDC study’s top 3 key findings.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/OMB-IDC_Social-Stat-2_1080x1920.jpg)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/OMB-IDC_Social-Stat-2_1080x1920.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccording to IDC, the study’s findings reflect a tipping point as AI gains momentum across industries. As companies worldwide go deeper with AI, Microsoft customers continue to deploy innovative new solutions and discover how tools like [Copilot can transform their day-to-day work](https://news.microsoft.com/source/?post_type=features&p=8580).

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI.

Gen AI democratisation\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGen AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGen AI has emerged as a powerful force in democratising innovation, placing sophisticated tools in the hands of individuals across various sectors. This technological leap forward has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for creative and analytical endeavours, enabling a broader range of users to harness AI\\\\'s capabilities without extensive technical expertise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe impact of this democratisation is particularly evident in the business world, where Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be using Gen AI APIs and models in production environments, a stark increase from less than 5% in 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shift signifies a move towards more inclusive and efficient business practices, with AI tools being integrated into everyday applications. For instance, sales teams can now utilise AI-powered chatbots and proposal generators to streamline their operations, enhancing productivity without the need for extensive data science teams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, this widespread adoption is not without its challenges. A Boston Consulting Group study revealed that over half of executives surveyed are actively discouraging the use of generative AI due to a lack of understanding, whilst 37% are in a state of experimentation without proper policies or controls in place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Multimodal AI\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 4: Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fD9SiYSpiwE/hqdefault.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultimodal AI represents a significant leap forward in AI, combining various data types such as text, images, audio, and video to create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Unlike traditional unimodal systems that rely on a single data type, multimodal AI integrates diverse inputs, enabling it to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and contextual awareness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt its core, multimodal AI comprises three key components: the input module, fusion module, and output module. The input module consists of multiple unimodal neural networks, each handling a different data type. The fusion module then processes and aligns the information from each modality, employing techniques such as early fusion to concatenate raw data. Finally, the output module delivers results that are often richer and more nuanced than those produced by unimodal systems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Explore the latest edition of_[_AI Magazine_](https://aimagazine.com/magazines)_and be part of the conversation at our global conference series,_[_Tech & AI LIVE_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Discover all our_[_upcoming events_](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)_and secure your tickets today._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_AI Magazine_ _is a_[_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)_brand_\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTags\\\\\\\\n----\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Ai](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Ai)[Technology](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Technology)[Top 10](https://aimagazine.com/search?q=Top%2010)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGlobal Events Program\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/original/56b0636423c3c19c8bae6799794d7e5a:1711177fd9997efefa2485128289204e/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025-dark-logo.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Join us in Singapore on November 4](https://technologymagazine.com/events/tech-and-ai-live/tech-ai-live-singapore-2025)Attend Now\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/9e903a884b23ac5e51801f561ae2e97c:396c4e0243970d67716f10a1f9e1881f/01-cover-ai-may2025.jpg)![Image 7](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/ca43aa688cdfe32da87b5e020a382af2:f54805cdfedc8a8764c8bd0dcc83d8ee/01-cover-ai-mar2025.jpg)![Image 8](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/321/fa38760b56c6ad79a5cec622275cb943:65aa8a8a2856761ad616a73c794fef31/00-cover-ai-jan2025.jpg)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Read Now](https://aimagazine.com/magazine)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelated Content\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   [Is ‘Zero Trust’ the Future of Data Centre Security?

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google\\\\'s all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\\\\\\\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI tools that use\\\\xa0[large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(And potentially disrupt Google\\\\'s [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\\\\\\\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal\\\\xa0or find a car to buy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of\\\\xa0[generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\\\\\\\\\"10 blue links\\\\\\\\\\\" with AI answers.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, \\\\\\\\\\\"AI search engine\\\\\\\\\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for \\\\\\\\\\\"Perplexity AI\\\\\\\\\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPerplexity has raised\\\\xa0[$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\\\\\\\\\"AI Overviews\\\\\\\\\\\" to many users.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\\\\\\\nGoogle\\\\'s AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd in the case of Google\\\\'s AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles\\\\xa0to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\\\\\\\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, what is NLP?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\'s basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\\\\\\\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\\\\\\\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\\\\\\\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 4. AI Helps Improve Healthcare Outcomes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOver the last year, in particular, AI has been incredibly transformative in the healthcare industry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “healthcare AI” has increased 426% over the last two years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Adoption among hospitals is surging — [90% of hospitals](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/90-of-hospitals-have-artificial-intelligence-strategies-in-place) have an AI strategy and 75% of hospital executives say AI initiatives are critical.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI, along with machine learning, is [speeding up several processes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/02/16/ai-for-health-and-hope-how-machine-learning-is-being-used-in-hospitals/?sh=1765c88a55be) in hospitals. This includes tasks like scanning handwritten data into an online platform, recording audio from doctor-patient conversations and converting it to text notes, and identifying patients for research studies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis technology is also becoming an essential tool in the midst of a hospital staffing crisis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2021, hospital staff turnover [grew 6.4%](https://www.nsinursingsolutions.com/Documents/Library/NSI_National_Health_Care_Retention_Report.pdf) to stand at nearly 26%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)  \\\\\\\\nHospital turnover in 2021 was nearly 8 points higher than in 2017.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearly [334,000 medical clinicians](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/finding-right-candidates-keeping-them-ai-aiding-healthcare-industry-meets) left the workforce in 2021 alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementing AI solutions helps bear the brunt of this staffing shortage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn one survey, 58% of hospital executives said AI was very or often effective in [improving operational performance](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-healthcare/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMany hospitals are turning to AI-powered staffing platforms like [DirectShifts](https://www.directshifts.com).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)  \\\\\\\\nThe DirectShifts platform utilizes AI to match job seekers with hospitals.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis platform uses AI to match clinicians with hospital job postings. The majority of these positions are per-diem, which are employees that hospitals may only need when the census is high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are currently more than 850,000 clinicians on the platform.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome hospitals are easing the burden placed on nurses by investing in AI systems that help monitor patients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Ouva’s AI-based platform](https://www.ouva.co/) constantly analyzes patient behavior and potential risks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)  \\\\\\\\nA view from Ouva’s dashboard.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe platform takes data from optical sensors and alerts nurses when high-risk patients have left their beds. It also monitors things like nurse visits, meal delivery, and arrival and discharge of patients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAI has the potential to impact the healthcare industry in numerous other ways, as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDrug development, disease diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans are just a few ways AI might be put to work in the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInvestors are paying attention to this sector, too.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMore than [$1.6 billion](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjH59nO38_9AhVQnGoFHat-CgQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.crunchbase.com%2Fhealth-wellness-biotech%2Fnested-cancer-treatment%2F&usg=AOvVaw3T5nvL1uRtmCpuUiV6FdWA) was invested in drug discovery startups in 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)  \\\\\\\\nSearch volume for “pharmaceutical AI” has grown 300% in recent years.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn one example, Microsoft continues to invest in healthcare AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe tech giant has partnered with [Paige](https://paige.ai) in order to apply AI technology to [improve cancer diagnosis](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005266/en/Paige-Collaborates-with-Microsoft-to-Transform-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-with-the-Use-of-Pathology-AI) and patient care.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPaige was the first company to receive FDA approval for using AI in digital pathology.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n***![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)  \\\\\\\\n[Paige’s AI tool](https://paige.ai/) helps pathologists identify regions that are likely to harbor cancer.***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 5.

From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\n\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\n\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\n\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\\\\\.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\n\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\n\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\\\n\\\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\\\n\\\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\\\n\\\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\\\n\\\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\\\n\\\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\\\n\\\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\\\n\\\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\\\n\\\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\\\n\\\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\\\n\\\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases. In the next 24 months, a greater focus will be placed on functional and industry use cases.\\\\n*   The top barrier when implementing AI is the lack of both technical and day-to-day AI skills.\\\\n\\\\n### **Learn how to fuel your AI journey**\\\\n\\\\nIDC’s study, which included more than 4,000 business leaders and AI decision-makers around the world, also identifies the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI. As businesses integrate new solutions, they navigate important considerations such as data privacy, responsible use and the need for investment in both technology and skills.\\\\n\\\\nNo matter where you are in your cloud and AI transformation journey, Microsoft can help.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\\\n\\\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\\\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\\\n\\\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\\\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\\\n\\\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\\\n\\\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\\\n\\\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\\\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\\\n\\\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\\\n\\\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\\\n\\\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\\\n\\\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\\\n\\\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\\\n\\\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\\\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\\\n\\\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\\\n\\\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\\\n\\\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\\\n\\\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\\\\\"10 blue links\\\\\\\" with AI answers.**\\\\n\\\\nFor example, \\\\\\\"AI search engine\\\\\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\\\nSearches for \\\\\\\"Perplexity AI\\\\\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\\\n\\\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\\\n\\\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\\\n\\\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\\\\\"AI Overviews\\\\\\\" to many users.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\\\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\\\n\\\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\\\n\\\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\\\n\\\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\\\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\\\n\\\\nOur world is wrapped in text.

Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\\\n\\\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\\\n\\\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\\\n\\\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\\\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven't been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\\\n\\\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\\\n\\\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\\\n\\\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\\\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\\\n\\\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\\\n\\\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\\\n\\\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\\\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\\\n\\\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\\\nThe [AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\\\n\\\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\\\n\\\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\\\n\\\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen. In the coming years, the vulnerabilities of AI may be exposed, and governments, agencies, and consumers will have to decide how to balance the risks and benefits.\\\\n\\\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\\\n\\\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\\\n\\\\n![newsletter banner](https://explodingtopics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/trends-database-blog-cta.png)\\\\n\\\\n#### Reveal More Competitor Secrets for Free\\\\n\\\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\\\n\\\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\\\n\\\\nShare\\\\n\\\\nNewsletter Signup\\\\n\\\\nBy clicking “Subscribe” you agree to Semrush Privacy Policy and consent to Semrush using your contact data for newsletter purposes\\\\n\\\\nWritten By\\\\n\\\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:120,height:120/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:64,height:64/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\\\n\\\\nJosh Howarth\\\\n\\\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\\\n\\\\nJosh is the Co-Founder and CTO of Exploding Topics.\\\\nJosh has led Exploding Topics product development from the first line of co...

Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\n\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\n\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\n\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\n\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\n\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\n\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases. In the next 24 months, a greater focus will be placed on functional and industry use cases.\\n*   The top barrier when implementing AI is the lack of both technical and day-to-day AI skills.\\n\\n### **Learn how to fuel your AI journey**\\n\\nIDC’s study, which included more than 4,000 business leaders and AI decision-makers around the world, also identifies the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI. As businesses integrate new solutions, they navigate important considerations such as data privacy, responsible use and the need for investment in both technology and skills.\\n\\nNo matter where you are in your cloud and AI transformation journey, Microsoft can help.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code.

Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\n\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\n\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\n\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\n\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\n\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven't been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\n\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\n\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\n\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\n\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\n\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\n\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\n\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\n\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\n\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\nThe [AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\n\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\n\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\n\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen. In the coming years, the vulnerabilities of AI may be exposed, and governments, agencies, and consumers will have to decide how to balance the risks and benefits.\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\n![newsletter banner](https://explodingtopics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/trends-database-blog-cta.png)\\n\\n#### Reveal More Competitor Secrets for Free\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nNewsletter Signup\\n\\nBy clicking “Subscribe” you agree to Semrush Privacy Policy and consent to Semrush using your contact data for newsletter purposes\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:120,height:120/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:64,height:64/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n\\nJosh Howarth\\n\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\n\\nJosh is the Co-Founder and CTO of Exploding Topics.\\nJosh has led Exploding Topics product development from the first line of co...

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\\\n\\\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\\\n\\\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\\\n\\\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\\\n-------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\\\n\\\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\\\n\\\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\\\n\\\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\\\n\\\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\\\n\\\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\\\n\\\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\\\n\\\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\\\\\.

of individuals Microsoft helped train and certify over the past year has been updated to 23 million and includes initiatives across Microsoft._\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024, generative AI emerged as a key driver

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\\\n\\\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\\\n\\\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\\\n\\\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\\\n\\\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\\\n\\\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\\\n> \\\\n> \\\\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\\\n\\\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\\\n\\\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\\\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\\\n\\\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\\\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\\\n\\\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\\\n\\\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\\\n\\\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\\\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\\\n\\\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\\\n\\\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\\\n\\\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\\\n\\\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\\\n\\\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\\\n\\\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\\\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\\\n\\\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\\\n\\\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\\\n\\\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\\\n\\\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\\\\\"10 blue links\\\\\\\" with AI answers.**\\\\n\\\\nFor example, \\\\\\\"AI search engine\\\\\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\\\nSearches for \\\\\\\"Perplexity AI\\\\\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\\\n\\\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\\\n\\\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\\\n\\\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\\\n\\\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\\\\\"AI Overviews\\\\\\\" to many users.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\\\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\\\n\\\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\\\n\\\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\\\n\\\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\\\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\\\n\\\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\\\n\\\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\\\n\\\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\\\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\\\n\\\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\\\n\\\\nSo, what is NLP?\\\\n\\\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\\\n\\\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\\\n\\\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\\\n\\\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\\\n\\\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\\\n\\\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\\\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\\\n\\\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\\\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\\\n\\\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\\\n\\\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\\\n\\\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\\\n\\\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\\\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\\\n\\\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\\\n\\\\n### 4. AI Helps Improve Healthcare Outcomes\\\\n\\\\nOver the last year, in particular, AI has been incredibly transformative in the healthcare industry.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)  \\\\nSearch volume for “healthcare AI” has increased 426% over the last two years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/AfIjIUKMSFuV7uEbjCwy)\\\\n\\\\n**Adoption among hospitals is surging — [90% of hospitals](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/90-of-hospitals-have-artificial-intelligence-strategies-in-place) have an AI strategy and 75% of hospital executives say AI initiatives are critical.**\\\\n\\\\nAI, along with machine learning, is [speeding up several processes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/02/16/ai-for-health-and-hope-how-machine-learning-is-being-used-in-hospitals/?sh=1765c88a55be) in hospitals. This includes tasks like scanning handwritten data into an online platform, recording audio from doctor-patient conversations and converting it to text notes, and identifying patients for research studies.\\\\n\\\\nThis technology is also becoming an essential tool in the midst of a hospital staffing crisis.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2021, hospital staff turnover [grew 6.4%](https://www.nsinursingsolutions.com/Documents/Library/NSI_National_Health_Care_Retention_Report.pdf) to stand at nearly 26%.\\\\n\\\\n***![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)  \\\\nHospital turnover in 2021 was nearly 8 points higher than in 2017.***\\\\n\\\\n![national-health-care-report-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/B7BtnLTTLmKTvW1Ggh2H)\\\\n\\\\nNearly [334,000 medical clinicians](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/finding-right-candidates-keeping-them-ai-aiding-healthcare-industry-meets) left the workforce in 2021 alone.\\\\n\\\\nImplementing AI solutions helps bear the brunt of this staffing shortage.\\\\n\\\\nIn one survey, 58% of hospital executives said AI was very or often effective in [improving operational performance](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-healthcare/).\\\\n\\\\nMany hospitals are turning to AI-powered staffing platforms like [DirectShifts](https://www.directshifts.com).\\\\n\\\\n***![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)  \\\\nThe DirectShifts platform utilizes AI to match job seekers with hospitals.***\\\\n\\\\n![directshifts-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/IAVOsueT2CteZRoE2Gop)\\\\n\\\\nThis platform uses AI to match clinicians with hospital job postings. The majority of these positions are per-diem, which are employees that hospitals may only need when the census is high.\\\\n\\\\nThere are currently more than 850,000 clinicians on the platform.\\\\n\\\\nSome hospitals are easing the burden placed on nurses by investing in AI systems that help monitor patients.\\\\n\\\\n[Ouva’s AI-based platform](https://www.ouva.co/) constantly analyzes patient behavior and potential risks.\\\\n\\\\n***![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)  \\\\nA view from Ouva’s dashboard.***\\\\n\\\\n![ouva-dashboard-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/oy2dMJUZTP2fFRJk3ErV)\\\\n\\\\nThe platform takes data from optical sensors and alerts nurses when high-risk patients have left their beds. It also monitors things like nurse visits, meal delivery, and arrival and discharge of patients.\\\\n\\\\nAI has the potential to impact the healthcare industry in numerous other ways, as well.\\\\n\\\\nDrug development, disease diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans are just a few ways AI might be put to work in the future.\\\\n\\\\nInvestors are paying attention to this sector, too.\\\\n\\\\nMore than [$1.6 billion](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjH59nO38_9AhVQnGoFHat-CgQQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.crunchbase.com%2Fhealth-wellness-biotech%2Fnested-cancer-treatment%2F&usg=AOvVaw3T5nvL1uRtmCpuUiV6FdWA) was invested in drug discovery startups in 2022.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)  \\\\nSearch volume for “pharmaceutical AI” has grown 300% in recent years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Gr6QDCT3TMyubzR3Z99g)\\\\n\\\\nIn one example, Microsoft continues to invest in healthcare AI.\\\\n\\\\nThe tech giant has partnered with [Paige](https://paige.ai) in order to apply AI technology to [improve cancer diagnosis](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005266/en/Paige-Collaborates-with-Microsoft-to-Transform-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-with-the-Use-of-Pathology-AI) and patient care.\\\\n\\\\nPaige was the first company to receive FDA approval for using AI in digital pathology.\\\\n\\\\n***![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)  \\\\n[Paige’s AI tool](https://paige.ai/) helps pathologists identify regions that are likely to harbor cancer.***\\\\n\\\\n![paige-clinical-use-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/V5eBPP3zTf6QRVxu0Iux)\\\\n\\\\n### 5.

Up to [7.9 million manufacturing jobs](https://www.kornferry.com/content/dam/kornferry/docs/pdfs/KF-Future-of-Work-Talent-Crunch-Report.pdf) will go unfilled by 2030, resulting in unrealized revenue totaling $607.14 billion.\\\\n\\\\n***![future-of-work-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VnpO60fJR7S96Gd23fRL)  \\\\nThe shortage of workers in manufacturing is expected to get much worse in the coming years.***\\\\n\\\\n![future-of-work-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VnpO60fJR7S96Gd23fRL)\\\\n\\\\nBy using computer vision, manufacturers are increasing the efficiency and performance of their facilities, as well as reducing staffing numbers.\\\\n\\\\n[Detecting anomalies](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/business-operations-room-blog/2022/computer-vision-manufacturing-ai.html) is one important role of computer vision in manufacturing.\\\\n\\\\nA computer vision system can track every step of the production process. If a step is missed or something is done out of order, an alarm is set off.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, the system knows how long a production cycle should take and can detect faults if the cycle runs too fast.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, when a faulty product is detected, workers can look up the item by its serial number to watch exactly what happened during the manufacturing process.\\\\n\\\\n[Instrumental](https://instrumental.com/) offers an AI/computer vision system that provides issue discovery and quality monitoring for electronics manufacturers. The system also performs end-to-end failure analysis.\\\\n\\\\n***![instrumental-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/qpY4wu4TFCRHjKWijFgm)  \\\\nInstrumental’s AI system allows manufacturers to find problems and fix them fast.***\\\\n\\\\n![instrumental-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/qpY4wu4TFCRHjKWijFgm)\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the company, their system results in a 43% reduction in rework and a 3x gain in product engineering efficiency.\\\\n\\\\nCompanies that install the system see a positive ROI in less than 60 days, they say.\\\\n\\\\nComputer vision is also being deployed in response to natural disasters and climate change issues.\\\\n\\\\nOne California startup, aptly named [Rain](https://www.rain.aero/), is using computer vision to fight wildfires.\\\\n\\\\n***![rain-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/FZmlGQoURbKeBYTGX2JY)  \\\\nRain’s aircraft is able to stay in the air for over an hour.***\\\\n\\\\n![rain-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/FZmlGQoURbKeBYTGX2JY)\\\\n\\\\nTheir product is an [unmanned autonomous helicopter](https://verticalmag.com/press-releases/rain-industries-announces-autonomous-firefighting-helicopter/) that uses AI and computer vision to deliver water to a wildfire before it grows out of control.\\\\n\\\\nThe company’s idea is to put these helicopters in high-risk areas that aren’t staffed by humans 24/7. If a wildfire broke out, the helicopter could be immediately deployed by a pilot at a remote location.\\\\n\\\\nThe project will be tested this year on real fires in California and the company projects they’ll build [200 helicopter stations](https://qz.com/firetech-forest-wildfire-startup-technology-1850205150) there.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, a team at the University of Cambridge recently developed a [computer vision system](https://www.zmescience.com/science/this-new-app-can-measure-trees-much-faster-than-manual-methods/) that allows scientists to monitor forests and carbon sequestration from their smartphones.\\\\n\\\\n***![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)  \\\\nThe computer vision system developed by the University of Cambridge utilizes LiDAR sensors.***\\\\n\\\\n![zmescience-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rQXYuL5oSmKRId1nk5ro)\\\\n\\\\nThe error rate is 8%, which is lower than the error rate occurring when humans complete the task.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time as it’s being deployed in a wide variety of industries, the technology of computer vision itself is being revolutionized.\\\\n\\\\nToday’s computer vision works by taking an image or series of images in still frames. Then the still frames are analyzed by the computer.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, one company is imagining computer vision that doesn’t need still frames.\\\\n\\\\n[Ubicept](https://www.ubicept.com/), a company formed in 2021, has developed computer vision that can [measure individual photons](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/10/ubicept-computer-vision/) instead of looking at still frames.\\\\n\\\\nThat process is faster and more reliable than traditional computer vision.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s especially beneficial for situations in which the camera needs to capture objects moving fast or objects in low light.\\\\n\\\\n***![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)  \\\\nUbicept’s [computer vision technology](https://www.ubicept.com/blog/viva-las-vegas) excels in low light and fast motion, two areas in which traditional computer vision falls short.***\\\\n\\\\n![ubicept-computer-vision-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/xancjTS2R6GWwntj2yQ1)\\\\n\\\\n### 7.

The market will hit $31.18 billion that year, according to estimates.\\\\n\\\\nAs of 2024, [40% of retailers are already using AI in some form](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1400301/ai-mv-and-cv-use-retail/).\\\\n\\\\nAnd the use of AI is continuing to grow.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Retail Technology Study, [40% of retail organizations](https://risnews.com/retail-tech-study-2022?from=gate) said shopper tracking capability was going to be one of their top tech investments within the next two years.\\\\n\\\\nLocation-based marketing, digital devices, and computer vision also made the list with more than one-third of retailers saying they’ll focus on those tech solutions in the next two years.\\\\n\\\\n***![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)  \\\\nRetail leaders are planning to invest heavily in AI in the next two years.***\\\\n\\\\n![retail-tech-study-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/wMrroMMT9KrNnfwkDr8m)\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most obvious uses of [AI in retail](https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-implement-ai-self-checkout-in-retail-if-you-are-not-amazon) is at checkout.\\\\n\\\\nStores like Amazon Go track customers through the store via computer vision. When a person puts an item in a physical cart, the computer vision catches which product it is and adds it to a virtual cart of sorts. When the person leaves the store, their digital wallet is charged accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nRetailers are also using [AI for inventory management](https://addepto.com/blog/ai-in-inventory-management/).\\\\n\\\\nAI systems can monitor stock levels in the warehouse and on shelves. When stock is running low, the system can automatically notify the proper channels and decrease the time it takes to replenish the product supply.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)  \\\\nSearch volume for “warehouse automation” has increased by 103% over the past 5 years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Yq4Nx37yQZKDGQ7PLg0o)\\\\n\\\\nMcKinsey reports that businesses that adopt [AI-enabled supply chains](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution) see a 15% improvement in logistics costs and a 35% improvement in inventory levels.\\\\n\\\\nAI also enables retailers to utilize dynamic pricing.\\\\n\\\\nWith data from the retailer, competitors, and customers, AI can be used to [adjust pricing in real time](https://segwitz.com/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-retail-industry/) and maximize profits.\\\\n\\\\nRetailers that use electronic shelf labels and AI-enabled dynamic pricing have the potential to [increase profit by 33%](https://revionics.com/blog/electronic-shelf-labels-price-optimization).\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most recent developments for retailers is generative AI.\\\\n\\\\nFor instance, [Shopify Magic](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-product-descriptions) was released in early 2023 as a tool that will write ecommerce product descriptions for retailers.\\\\n\\\\n***![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)  \\\\nShopify Magic enables retailers to create product descriptions in seconds.***\\\\n\\\\n![shopify-magic-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yGcK6lwTsuV91KIEpWkI)\\\\n\\\\nShopify says they’ll be adding more tools with AI in the near future.\\\\n\\\\nRetailers are also utilizing generative AI to create in-store displays.\\\\n\\\\nBy inserting a few prompts into a program like DALL-E, retailers can come up with a visual concept and merchandising imagery.\\\\n\\\\nOne retailer said her team typically spends a week brainstorming and [creating imagery for a new in-store design](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/in-store-innovation/how-store-design-teams-are-unlocking-tangible-value-from-ai-platforms).\\\\n\\\\nWith AI, they were able to do it in just eight hours.\\\\n\\\\n***![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)  \\\\nAn example of an AI-generated concept for a luxury fashion store.***\\\\n\\\\n![apparel-store-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/miNTwDsQwuXOgkxvxqk9)\\\\n\\\\nApparel companies are also using generative AI to create hundreds of recommended outfit combinations that appear on their websites and apps.\\\\n\\\\nBy working with the company [Stylitics](https://stylitics.com/), Puma was able to [increase conversions by 235%](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/inventory-merchandising/puma-using-ai-powered-styling-brainstorm-with-customers-increase-aov-stylitics-visual-merchandising) and session duration by 334%.\\\\n\\\\n***![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)  \\\\nStylitics’ AI-powered solution puts together outfit combinations and replaces outfit pieces as they go out of stock.***\\\\n\\\\n![stylitics-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/dlbVFvjUSQuqqNqPl5Cu)\\\\n\\\\n### 8. Increasing Potential for AI Risks and Regulations\\\\n\\\\nAs AI adoption has increased, the level of risk mitigation has remained the same.\\\\n\\\\nThis means that many enterprises aren’t paying attention to the risks associated with AI.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/WrGBbkv4TXatpu5TEUga)  \\\\nSearch volume for “AI risks” is up more than 700% since 2019.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/WrGBbkv4TXatpu5TEUga)\\\\n\\\\nWhen looking at the past three years, a survey from McKinsey showed no substantial increase in the amount of attention companies are giving any [AI-related risks](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#review). This includes cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, privacy, and explainability.\\\\n\\\\n***![mckinsey-state-of-ai-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/zEeklCxqSVax2XeuWNaP)  \\\\nMcKinsey called the lack of focus on AI risks “concerning.”***\\\\n\\\\n![mckinsey-state-of-ai-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/zEeklCxqSVax2XeuWNaP)\\\\n\\\\nThe list of [potential risks](https://ai100.stanford.edu/2021-report/standing-questions-and-responses/sq10-what-are-most-pressing-dangers-ai) is long — and it keeps growing.\\\\n\\\\nThe Wharton School created an extensive paper outlining [the risks of using AI in business](https://aiab.wharton.upenn.edu/research/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/). Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\\\n\\\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\\\n\\\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\\\n\\\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\\\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven't been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\\\n\\\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\\\n\\\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\\\n\\\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\\\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\\\n\\\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\\\n\\\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\\\n\\\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\\\n\\\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\\\n\\\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\\\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\\\n\\\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\\\n\\\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\\\nThe [AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\\\n\\\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\\\n\\\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\\\n\\\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen.

Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\n\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\n\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\n\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\n\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\n\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\n\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases. In the next 24 months, a greater focus will be placed on functional and industry use cases.\\n*   The top barrier when implementing AI is the lack of both technical and day-to-day AI skills.\\n\\n### **Learn how to fuel your AI journey**\\n\\nIDC’s study, which included more than 4,000 business leaders and AI decision-makers around the world, also identifies the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI. As businesses integrate new solutions, they navigate important considerations such as data privacy, responsible use and the need for investment in both technology and skills.\\n\\nNo matter where you are in your cloud and AI transformation journey, Microsoft can help.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code.

Poor data quality, data attacks, lack of transparency, and bias were just a few of the topics discussed.\\n\\nIn recent months, there have been signs from companies, consumers, and the US government showing a shifting focus toward these risks and AI safety.\\n\\nAnother report from McKinsey shows that [72% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters) believe that it’s important to know a company’s AI policy before they make a purchase.\\n\\nIn that same survey, 55% of business leaders said they’d suffered an AI incident in the past three years.\\n\\nIn another survey, nearly [two-thirds of people in the US](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ai-regulation-seedai) said they wanted regulations placed on AI in the near future.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)  \\nSearch volume for “AI regulation” has increased by more than 857% in recent years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/H2OTihimSP6CrEuMR4Rn)\\n\\nHowever, outside of the EU, governments haven't been quick to offer up any laws or oversight.\\n\\nAs of May 2024, there haven’t been any bills proposed in Congress that would [limit the reach of AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/business/dealbook/lawmakers-ai-regulations.html).\\n\\nIn late 2022, the White House released an [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) that was aimed at encouraging companies to police the use of AI within their ranks, but it has no authority.\\n\\n***![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)  \\nThe AI Bill of Rights encourages businesses to adequately assess their AI systems and correct potential problems.***\\n\\n![ai-bill-of-rights-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/daBGBjpSSqi360zALzdt)\\n\\nHowever, federal agencies are upping their involvement in AI regulation.\\n\\nThe FTC, FDA, and CFPB are all acting in some way to curb the use of unethical AI.\\n\\nIn one case, the [FTC took action against Weight Watchers](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) for improperly collecting information from children and creating AI models from the data.\\n\\nMore federal-level action on AI regulation has taken place in Europe.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)  \\nSearch interest in “AI Act” is up more than 2,200%.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/Tr0Dg0U7RCu0vbCf6wIO)\\n\\n***![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)  \\nThe [AI Act](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/eu-ai-act-explainer/) looks at applications based on their level of potential risk.***\\n\\n![ai-act-explainer-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ViPp8I8XQLmgVcIHPyXD)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThat wraps up our list of the top AI trends to watch over the next few years.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence, and the tech solutions it powers, will undoubtedly change the way businesses and individuals operate in the world.\\n\\nIn many industries, AI will drive the development of methods and processes that we’ve never seen before. This has the potential to increase efficiency, lessen the impact of the labor shortage, and prompt businesses to create new revenue streams.\\n\\nHowever, the true risks of AI remain to be seen. In the coming years, the vulnerabilities of AI may be exposed, and governments, agencies, and consumers will have to decide how to balance the risks and benefits.\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\n![newsletter banner](https://explodingtopics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/trends-database-blog-cta.png)\\n\\n#### Reveal More Competitor Secrets for Free\\n\\n#### Stop Guessing, Start Growing 🚀\\n\\nUse real-time topic data to create content that resonates and brings results.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nNewsletter Signup\\n\\nBy clicking “Subscribe” you agree to Semrush Privacy Policy and consent to Semrush using your contact data for newsletter purposes\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:120,height:120/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n![](https://cdn.buttercms.com/resize=width:64,height:64/output=f:webp/zeRcXajS1WfPs6J5tVBm)\\n\\nJosh Howarth\\n\\nCo-Founder & CTO\\n\\nJosh is the Co-Founder and CTO of Exploding Topics.\\nJosh has led Exploding Topics product development from the first line of co...

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sidney Fernandes, CIO & VP of Digital Experiences at University of South Florida_\\n\\n### [![Image 4: A graphic showing key data from the IDC study. ](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/11/NEW-IDC_Social-Stat-10x-_1920x1080_Final-Final_11_11_24.png)\\n\\n### **AI’s growing economic impact**\\n\\nWhile companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.\\n\\n“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”\\n\\nKey findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:\\n\\n*   Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.\\n*   For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.\\n*   The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.\\n*   On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.\\n*   Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.\\n*   The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.\\n*   43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.\\n*   The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\n\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\n\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\n\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\n\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\n\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\n\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\n\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\n\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\n\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\n\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\n\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\n\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\n\\n### 4.

AI didn’t just evolve— It redefined what’s possible, shaping industries with advancements that stretched across customer service, cybersecurity, and even medical research.  AI adoption is accelerating rapidly as companies look for new ways to increase efficiencies further and drive innovation.\\n\\nReflecting on another pivotal year for AI, here’s a look into the 8 biggest AI trends that made headlines in 2024.\\n\\n1\\\\. Generative AI: From Hype to Essential Business Tool\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/in-blog-2024-AI-recap_AI-usage-increase-1024x398.png)\\n\\nIn just one year, from 2023 to 2024, generative AI dramatically shifted from a phase of rapid experimentation to a period of essential integrations into business operations. Furthermore, [IDC’s global survey](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch/) of enterprise organizations found that generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding with usage figures jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75%. Across industries, businesses began to embed AI into their core operations —particularly generative AI, which has rapidly taken hold in marketing and sales functions, where text-based communications and personalization serve as key drivers.  Companies in financial services, retail, and media have used generative AI to personalize customer experiences, reduce time-to-market, and streamline operations. In short, generative AI has transitioned from hype and proof-of-concept experiments to broader adoption, with companies emphasizing real-world implementations with tangible results.\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/ad49616dad180b71b08861433333c330)\\n\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT played a key role in this surge. By December 2024, [ChatGPT reached 300 million weekly active users](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html)—up from 200 million just four months prior. This explosive growth is a sign that generative AI is no longer a futuristic concept but an essential, versatile tool—one that’s quickly becoming more ingrained with our culture and society both professionally and personally—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\n2\\\\. Multimodal AI: Diverse Content from One Model\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother significant AI trend was the major advancements in multimodal AI—systems that understand and generate text, images, and audio from a single interface. Multimodal AI reduces the need for multiple specialized tools, making it easier for organizations to create and manage diverse content. Fun fact: the cover image of this blog was created using multimodal AI, courtesy of [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).\\n\\nTwo major players, [OpenAI’s Sora](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and [Google’s Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-1/), captured the AI spotlight by providing impressive text-to-video capabilities. These tools promise to simplify content production for marketing, media, and education, allowing users to generate video content directly from a written prompt. The result? Faster production cycles and reduced creative bottlenecks.\\n\\n3\\\\. Reasoning AI: Solving Complex Problems\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most game-changing AI trends this year was the focus on building robust reasoning capabilities into AI systems. From new prompting methods to new model training techniques to new AI agent architectures, there have been many different approaches to building AI systems capable of solving increasingly complex tasks by iteratively planning, solving, and evaluating their work.\\n\\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like  [OpenAI’s o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), can already solve complex problems using logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s [Phi models](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/the-phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential/) demonstrated how smaller models, when trained on high-quality data, can improve model performance and reasoning. Meanwhile, Orca and [Orca 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?msockid=1dbcd2bacdc96a0e1328c686cc736b2f) showed how synthetic data for post-training could improve model performance, making small models as capable as much larger language models. These training techniques help smaller models perform better on specialized tasks. Making models faster, better and more specialized will help create new and more useful AI experiences.\\n\\n4\\\\. AI Agents: From Reactive to Proactive\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents are swiftly evolving and transcending across differing business types and industries. [AI Agents extend the ability of LLMs](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-agent-systems/) by equipping the model with tools and enabling it to act on a user’s behalf. Nearly [70% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to offload repetitive tasks like email triage and meeting notes via Teams. But Microsoft didn’t stop there. Microsoft introduced [new agents in Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/introducing-new-agents-in-microsoft-365/4296918) to streamline entire business processes, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/f19e56331cf34a059197d5fb5b6082dc)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s AI Agent Assist](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-powered-next-gen-agents-accelerating-onboarding-and-boosting-productivity-for-the-heartbeat-of-the-utility-call-center/) is one standout example. By using large language models (LLMs), AI Agent Assist provides call center agents with quick access to information and real-time support, which improves service quality by 40%. As a result, this allows call centers to transform customer service from reactive to proactive, boosting productivity and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nThese enhancements represent a significant leap in collaboration and information management, simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity across organizations.\\n\\n5\\\\. Cybersecurity: A Must-Have Strategy\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nCybersecurity continued to be a pressing concern in 2024, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role. According to the [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2024#section-master-oc537b), AI integration into cyber defense improved threat detection and response. With over 176,000 incidents detected across 5,600 organizations in May alone, the scale of cyber threats underscored the urgency for advanced defenses.\\n\\nAI-powered tools enhanced capabilities like anomaly detection, threat analysis, and remediation, which are critical given the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks. Operational technology systems and AI itself were key targets for attackers, exploiting system vulnerabilities and enabling large-scale social engineering attacks. To combat this, businesses relied on AI to streamline processes like data labeling, policy enhancement, and monitoring generative AI applications to prevent oversharing or leaks.\\n\\nIn 2024, it became clear that AI-driven solutions weren’t just beneficial but were also critical to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.\\n\\n6\\\\. Ethical and Responsible AI: Rules Get Real\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith AI becoming more prevalent, the conversation around ethics and regulation intensified in 2024. Governments worldwide introduced new AI regulations aimed at protecting privacy, ensuring accountability, and preventing misuse. In the US, there are more than [120 AI bills](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-united-states) under review by the Congress.\\n\\nGovernments worldwide have introduced new laws designed to regulate AI technologies, particularly as it relates to data privacy and ethics. One of the most influential frameworks is the [European Union’s AI Act](https://hyperight.com/panel-european-artificial-intelligence-act-and-how-it-will-impact-data-and-ai-innovation-efforts-across-industries-and-functions/), which establishes clear rules for AI deployment in Europe. These regulations aim to protect users from risks related to AI, such as biased algorithms and data misuse. Companies operating in Europe will now need to ensure their AI tools meet compliance standards.\\n\\n7\\\\. AI at Work: Smarter and Faster Operations\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAI is not only changing how businesses operate, but also redefining entire industries. From supply chain optimization to predictive analytics, AI tools helped companies make smarter and faster decisions.\\n\\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/f2865e73526a85a7b49fb80078261209)\\n\\n[Neudesic’s Supply Chain Control Tower](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-benefits/) is a prime example. The platform provides organizations real-time visibility to manage and optimize their supply chain performance. This results in a 50% faster resolution time and a 20% cost reduction.\\n\\nIn the utilities sector, [Neudesic’s State of AI in Energy & Utilities Report](https://www.neudesic.com/ebook/state-of-ai-in-utilities/) revealed that AI adoption is driving modernization across utility companies, with 66% of organizations seeing operational improvements. From grid management to energy forecasting, AI-powered analytics are helping utilities become more agile and efficient.\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44bd0dc0e095a0e9eb5ee79dbf45f0d4)\\n\\n8\\\\. AI in Science: Faster Scientific Discoveries, Better Healthcare\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLastly, another notable AI trend is the significant advancements in science and medicine, improving both the efficiency of scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics and treatments.\\n\\nTake the [Da Vinci Surgical System](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/da-vinci-robotic-surgery/about-the-systems#:~:text=Your%20surgeon%20in%20control,or%20a%20few%20small%20incisions.&text=The%20da%20Vinci%20system%20is,back%20to%20what%20matters%20most.), which uses an AI robot to facilitate minimally invasive surgical procedures. By enhancing precision and control, the system helps surgeons perform complex operations with reduced recovery times for patients.\\n\\nIn medicine, models like [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) have improved genetic mutation classification. This technology increases the accuracy of genetic diagnostics, helping doctors predict the likelihood of diseases linked to genetic mutations. Such advancements are paving the way for more personalized medicine and earlier disease detection.\\n\\nLooking Ahead to 2025\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe 2024 AI trends showed us that AI isn’t just an experiment— it’s becoming an integral part of our business operations and in our society. Generative AI is now a daily tool, multimodal AI simplifies content creation, and reasoning AI solves real-world problems. With AI agents optimizing workflows and ethical AI guiding regulatory compliance, the future of AI feels more collaborative and grounded in responsibility.\\n\\nAs businesses continue to adopt AI for competitive advantage, one thing is clear: 2025 is likely to bring even more sophisticated AI capabilities that are easier to use and harder to ignore.\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n[From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\nBusinesses have long relied on AI to automate specific tasks—from predictive \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/agentic-ai-business-capability-models/ \\\"From automation to autonomy: Reshaping enterprise architecture with agentic AI and business capability models\\\")\\n\\n[Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\nMarch 2025 has brought a fresh wave of AI innovations \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/top-5-ai-trends-march-2025/ \\\"Top 5 AI trends in March 2025: AI agents, smarter supply chains, and more \\\")\\n\\n[How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\nA $10M fine that could have been avoided  Last year, \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-regulatory-compliance-utility-sector/ \\\"How AI turns regulatory compliance nightmares into business wins for utilities\\\")\\n\\n[Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\nLet’s be real— insurance claims are often a source of \\\\[…\\\\]\\n\\n[![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/61cfc1675a383319f36f6085e0cebb5a)](https://www.neudesic.com/blog/ai-driven-stp-auto-insurance-claims/ \\\"Revving up straight-through processing for auto insurance claims with intelligent automation\\\")\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.neudesic.com/wp-content/uploads/profile-tula-masterman-300x300.jpg)\\n\\nTula Masterman\\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist with Applied AI Expertise\\n\\n[tula.masterman@neudesic.com](mailto:tula.masterman@neudesic.com)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSign up for emails on new digital articles and other news\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nI agree to allow Neudesic to use my contact details to keep me informed about products, services, and offers.

We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.\\n\\n**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu_\\n\\n**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.**In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries._\\n> \\n> \\n> **_“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”_**\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries_\\n\\n**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence_\\n\\n**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”**_\\n> \\n> \\n> _— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra_\\n\\n**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the **[Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG)**, which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.\\n\\nThat is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.\\n\\n> **Customer snapshot:**\\n> \\n> \\n> _The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI._\\n> \\n> \\n> _**“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce.

Big Tech Enters an AI Arms Race\\n\\nIn 2024 big tech started to invest serious amounts of capital into AI.\\n\\nThis includes large-scale investment into projects [like Google's all-in approach to AI search](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-generative-ai-search-summaries-announcement-ffab4ce1).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)  \\nGoogle has invested significant capital into making AI overviews a standard feature of the search results.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/hbj1knCRIK07XEEO2zwY)\\n\\n**However, big tech companies are also backing startups in the AI space.**\\n\\nIn fact, on a YoY basis, big tech has invested [57% more funds into AI startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-ai-investments/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)  \\nMajor players in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, and Amazon) are backing a number if AI companies.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/VkNlaK14SNm8kwCRKjrP)\\n\\nNotable examples of this trend include:\\n\\n### 2. Companies Race to Develop AI Search\\n\\nAI tools that use [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm) have the potential to change how people find information online.\\n\\n(And potentially disrupt Google's [dominance of the search market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)  \\nInterest in “AI search” has grown significantly in 2024.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/z13rawVHSN2psVJk9ITL)\\n\\nThe underlying LLMs behind an interface like ChatGPT work by first analyzing large amounts of information and “learning” it. From this, the model recognizes patterns and can predict words and phrases that are meant to go together.\\n\\nSo, when a person types in a search query in natural language, the AI search platform can predict a sequence of human language that will answer the question.\\n\\n**Instead of producing a list of relevant websites, the tool gives written answers pulled from a combination of different sources.**\\n\\nAnd, these platforms go way beyond simple queries like finding the capital of Brazil or the current temperature.\\n\\nUsers can query broad questions like how to plan a dinner party meal or find a car to buy.\\n\\nIn this way, AI search is another form of [generative AI](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/generative-ai): AI that can create new content like images, audio, code, and, in this case, text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)  \\nSearch volume for “generative AI” is exploding.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/JwAZyD8T6qneKgZI1NEs)\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/why-were-all-obsessed-with-the-mind-blowing-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/) is a generative AI platform that went viral at the end of 2022.\\n\\nGenerative AI platforms like ChatGPT allow users to enter a question into the tool and it will provide an answer.\\n\\nThat means it can have very human-like conversations and complete commands to generate content.\\n\\nHowever, most AI platforms are not built primarily for answering search queries.\\n\\n**Which is why a number of companies are attempting to replace \\\"10 blue links\\\" with AI answers.**\\n\\nFor example, \\\"AI search engine\\\" [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)  \\nSearches for \\\"Perplexity AI\\\" have increased significantly over the last two years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/yiFP71CwSBChvDOVVcsZ)\\n\\n[Perplexity’s AI search chatbot](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/perplexity-ai/) can provide information in real time and it provides citations for the information.\\n\\nPerplexity has raised [$165M in VC funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai). Notably, the platform has a passionate group of regular users (maybe of which are using Perplexity in place of Google search).\\n\\nHowever, Perplexity is facing a significant threat: **big tech players have now entered the race to become the go-to generative AI search platform.**\\n\\nMicrosoft debuted their [AI-powered version of Bing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-taps-chatgpt-to-improve-bing-and-the-edge-browser/) in early February 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it’s run by ChatGPT technology, Microsoft claims it’s even faster and more accurate because it’s specifically built for search.\\n\\nThe platform allows users to ask follow up questions to a search and it can also generate new content.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out \\\"AI Overviews\\\" to many users.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)  \\nGoogle's AI overviews provide searchers a direct answer to their query (with links to sources).***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/rbjjQVAQaaW7nOPDPl8Q)\\n\\nDespite the early popularity of these tools, many in the industry are quick to point out that AI search chatbots are in their infancy.\\n\\nAnd in the case of Google's AI overviews, [there are still many accuracy hurdles to work through](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cringe-worth-google-ai-overviews).\\n\\n### 3. Natural Language Processing Drives New Use Cases for AI\\n\\nFew things in the AI industry have more promising business use cases than natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)  \\nSearch volume for “natural language processing” is growing.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/152CfchRaOBZmnbBzK0F)\\n\\nOur world is wrapped in text. Analyzing, formatting, translating, and using texts is essential to all types of business around the world.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just words. NLP is being used to [analyze data](https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing) in ways that are far different from prior statistical methods we’ve used.\\n\\n***![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)  \\nWith an NLP tool, organizations can process data up to 10x faster and analyze unstructured data via human language.***\\n\\n![nlp-tool-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/TAU5frk4SVquQhZAs5O7)\\n\\nSo, what is NLP?\\n\\nIt's basically a way for [computers to speak human language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP).\\n\\nIn the past, computers were only able to understand human language if it was first translated into code. But by using NLP, machines are able to gain intelligence from text as it sits in its natural state.\\n\\nEstimates show the [amount of data in the world](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day) could hit [612 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/chart/17727/global-data-creation-forecasts/) by 2030 and 2,142 zettabytes by 2035.\\n\\nMuch of this is human-readable text, so businesses can use NLP in order to determine the sentiment of text, [classify text](https://monkeylearn.com/what-is-text-classification/), extract meaning and keywords from text, and analyze text.\\n\\nThis provides an efficient way to analyze and gain insights from enormous amounts of data — something that just isn’t possible without the use of NLP.\\n\\n[MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com) is an AI text analysis tool that can analyze reviews, surveys, support tickets, and other sources of human text.\\n\\n***![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)  \\nSearches for “MonkeyLearn” are up 200% in the past 5 years.***\\n\\n![undefined](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/BzrDUGu9S12PBysIdbd3)\\n\\nBusinesses from dozens of sectors like retail, marketing, and finance are already using Monkeylearn.\\n\\n***![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)  \\nThe MonkeyLearn platform uses AI/machine learning to automatically tag text from emails, reviews, social media, and other sources.***\\n\\n![monkeylearn-studio-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/ptJK0dYiScW6mTsu0loE)\\n\\nIn the legal and commercial space, dozens of companies have begun using NLP to analyze dense legal documents, as well as generate new ones.\\n\\nFor example, a company called [BlackBoiler](https://www.blackboiler.com/) offers AI technology that uses NLP to analyze contracts and suggest changes in places where clauses might be disputed.\\n\\nThe platform does all of this through a process that’s similar to “track changes” in a word processor program.\\n\\n***![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)  \\nBlackBoiler’s AI tool utilizes patented technology to suggest and accept changes to contracts automatically.***\\n\\n![blackboiler-min.webp](https://cdn.buttercms.com/output=f:webp/MivfrfrSguemmJedzm5y)\\n\\n### 4.
