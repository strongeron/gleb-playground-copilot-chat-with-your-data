On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question.

IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef search_agent(\\\"Your query goes here.\\\") -> str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nwhat are the AI trends in 2025\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n## 1.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.\n        question: The question to answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n```python\ndef search_agent(\"Your query goes here.\") -> str:\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

You will need to 1. build a survey of facts known or needed to solve the task, then 2. make a plan of action to solve the task.\n\n## 1. Facts survey\nYou will build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.\nThese \"facts\" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\nList here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\nList here any facts that we may need to look up.\nAlso list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\nList here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.\n\nDon't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Do not add anything else on top of three headings above.\n\n## 2. Plan\nThen for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\n\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optionally restrict results to a certain year', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n---\nNow begin!

Facts given in the task\\n• Request to find forecasts or predictions about AI in 2025.  \\n• They want data from recognized industry analysts, experts, or reputable publications.  \\n• They want a summary of the top 5 trends and major use cases in AI by 2025.\\n\\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\\n• Authoritative market reports or forecasts about AI in 2025 (e.g., from Gartner, IDC, McKinsey, Deloitte, etc.).  \\n  Reasoning: We need recognized publications or organizations.  \\n• Notable experts’ or industry analysts’ viewpoints on AI trends in 2025.  \\n  Reasoning: The task explicitly requests recognized expert opinions.  \\n• Specific mentions of major use cases of AI in 2025 as predicted by these sources.  \\n  Reasoning: The user wants relevant real-world applications.\\n\\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\\n• Synthesize the top five trends (based on the external sources) that are likely to dominate AI in 2025.  \\n  Reasoning: We must summarize and distill multiple sources into five key points.  \\n• Identify major use cases (such as in manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, etc.) and condense them into a concise summary.  \\n  Reasoning: Organizing major use cases by sector or category is needed as part of the summary.\\n\\n## 2. Plan\\n1. Use a web search tool (e.g., “web_search”) with queries like “AI 2025 forecasts from Gartner,” “AI 2025 predictions from IDC,” etc., to gather relevant authoritative resources.  \\n2. Collect reputable articles, reports, or summaries from well-known analysis firms.  \\n3. Visit the most relevant pages (e.g., from Gartner, IDC, McKinsey) using “visit_page” to extract detailed content.  \\n4. Compile the predictions, focusing on any numerical statistics or specific trends they mention.  \\n5. Identify the top five most commonly cited trends across all resources.  \\n6. Gather examples of big AI use cases highlighted (e.g., automation, healthcare, finance).  \\n7. Summarize findings into cohesive points, ensuring correctness and clarity for each of the five trends and associated use cases.  \\n8.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optionally restrict results to a certain year', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"

Facts given in the task\n• Request to find forecasts or predictions about AI in 2025.  \n• They want data from recognized industry analysts, experts, or reputable publications.  \n• They want a summary of the top 5 trends and major use cases in AI by 2025.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n• Authoritative market reports or forecasts about AI in 2025 (e.g., from Gartner, IDC, McKinsey, Deloitte, etc.).  \n  Reasoning: We need recognized publications or organizations.  \n• Notable experts’ or industry analysts’ viewpoints on AI trends in 2025.  \n  Reasoning: The task explicitly requests recognized expert opinions.  \n• Specific mentions of major use cases of AI in 2025 as predicted by these sources.  \n  Reasoning: The user wants relevant real-world applications.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n• Synthesize the top five trends (based on the external sources) that are likely to dominate AI in 2025.  \n  Reasoning: We must summarize and distill multiple sources into five key points.  \n• Identify major use cases (such as in manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, etc.) and condense them into a concise summary.  \n  Reasoning: Organizing major use cases by sector or category is needed as part of the summary.\n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Use a web search tool (e.g., “web_search”) with queries like “AI 2025 forecasts from Gartner,” “AI 2025 predictions from IDC,” etc., to gather relevant authoritative resources.  \n2. Collect reputable articles, reports, or summaries from well-known analysis firms.  \n3. Visit the most relevant pages (e.g., from Gartner, IDC, McKinsey) using “visit_page” to extract detailed content.  \n4. Compile the predictions, focusing on any numerical statistics or specific trends they mention.  \n5. Identify the top five most commonly cited trends across all resources.  \n6. Gather examples of big AI use cases highlighted (e.g., automation, healthcare, finance).  \n7. Summarize findings into cohesive points, ensuring correctness and clarity for each of the five trends and associated use cases.  \n8. Provide the final consolidated summary that includes the short version, the in-depth version, and additional context, if relevant.\n\n\n```"

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nThe leading forecasts from major analysts and experts for AI in 2025 highlight rapidly expanding AI investments, widespread enterprise adoption (especially of generative AI), the rise of self-governing or autonomous “agentic AI” systems, intensifying focus on AI ethics/governance, and broad real-world use cases across industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\n\\\\n• Growth and Market Size:\\\\n  – Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on generative AI alone could exceed $600 billion by 2025, a massive jump over prior years. Other estimates peg the generative AI market size at around $60+ billion in 2025, with an annual growth rate above 40% into 2030.\\\\n  – McKinsey estimates a total potential economic impact of AI at $4.4 trillion in productivity growth from business use cases, suggesting that large-scale AI deployments will be ubiquitous in 2025 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n• Trend #1: Enterprise-Wide Operationalization of AI\\\\n  – According to Gartner research, up to 75% of enterprises are expected to operationalize AI by 2025, rising from below 15% in 2021. This adoption surge includes not only large corporations but also small and medium-sized companies ramping up AI-enabled processes.\\\\n\\\\n• Trend #2: Rapid Advancement of Generative AI\\\\n  – Generative AI (e.g., language models, image generators, code assistants) remains a top trend through 2025, with forecasts of significant investment, new products, and an evolution of existing business models. Deloitte projects that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents (autonomous software assistants) by 2025.\\\\n\\\\n• Trend #3: Emergence of “Agentic AI” / Autonomous AI\\\\n  – Gartner and Deloitte foresee the rise of more autonomous AI that can make decisions and learn continuously with minimal human oversight, sometimes referred to as “agentic AI.” The technology is expected to be transformative in areas requiring adaptive decision-making—for instance, dynamic supply chain management.\\\\n\\\\n• Trend #4: Increasing Emphasis on AI Governance, Ethics, and Regulation\\\\n  – Forbes and industry analyses stress that as AI becomes more pervasive, governance frameworks and regulatory compliance will grow in importance. Companies will need stricter controls around data handling, bias mitigation, and accountability to stay competitive and meet legal requirements.\\\\n\\\\n• Trend #5: Convergence of AI with Data Analytics and Cloud Platforms\\\\n  – A LinkedIn article and multiple expert reports (e.g., McKinsey) show that advanced analytics and cloud-based infrastructures will become even more entwined with AI solutions by 2025, speeding up data access, integration, and insights.\\\\n\\\\n• Major Use Cases by 2025:\\\\n  – Healthcare: Radiology diagnostics, patient triage, drug discovery, and personalized treatment.\\\\n  – Finance: Fraud detection, automated risk modeling, algorithmic trading, chatbots for customer service.\\\\n  – Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and robotics-driven automation.\\\\n  – Retail and E-commerce: Product recommendation engines, dynamic pricing, supply chain optimization.\\\\n  – Marketing & Customer Engagement: Automated content generation, sentiment analysis, and hyper-personalized targeting.\\\\n  – Workplace Productivity: AI assistants for scheduling, data analysis, and knowledge management.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\n• The specific numerical forecasts can vary widely depending on methodology, but nearly all respected analysts (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, IDC, etc.) agree AI will continue its rapid expansion through 2025.\\\\n• “Generative AI” is a principal focus for many organizations, but more traditional forms of AI (machine learning-based analytics, computer vision, robotic process automation) continue to see strong adoption too.\\\\n• Key challenges that remain include availability of quality data, regulatory clarity, talent shortages, and organizational readiness. These factors may slow or accelerate adoption depending on how companies respond.\\\\n\\\"}\",\"name\":\"final_answer\"},\"type\":\"function\"}]}}],\"created\":1751474488,\"model\":\"o1-2024-12-17\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":\"default\",\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_334c74d916\",\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":1896,\"prompt_tokens\":3841,\"total_tokens\":5737,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":1024,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":2816}}}"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optionally restrict results to a certain year', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"

Facts given in the task\n• Request to find forecasts or predictions about AI in 2025.  \n• They want data from recognized industry analysts, experts, or reputable publications.  \n• They want a summary of the top 5 trends and major use cases in AI by 2025.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n• Authoritative market reports or forecasts about AI in 2025 (e.g., from Gartner, IDC, McKinsey, Deloitte, etc.).  \n  Reasoning: We need recognized publications or organizations.  \n• Notable experts’ or industry analysts’ viewpoints on AI trends in 2025.  \n  Reasoning: The task explicitly requests recognized expert opinions.  \n• Specific mentions of major use cases of AI in 2025 as predicted by these sources.  \n  Reasoning: The user wants relevant real-world applications.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n• Synthesize the top five trends (based on the external sources) that are likely to dominate AI in 2025.  \n  Reasoning: We must summarize and distill multiple sources into five key points.  \n• Identify major use cases (such as in manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, etc.) and condense them into a concise summary.  \n  Reasoning: Organizing major use cases by sector or category is needed as part of the summary.\n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Use a web search tool (e.g., “web_search”) with queries like “AI 2025 forecasts from Gartner,” “AI 2025 predictions from IDC,” etc., to gather relevant authoritative resources.  \n2. Collect reputable articles, reports, or summaries from well-known analysis firms.  \n3. Visit the most relevant pages (e.g., from Gartner, IDC, McKinsey) using “visit_page” to extract detailed content.  \n4. Compile the predictions, focusing on any numerical statistics or specific trends they mention.  \n5. Identify the top five most commonly cited trends across all resources.  \n6. Gather examples of big AI use cases highlighted (e.g., automation, healthcare, finance).  \n7. Summarize findings into cohesive points, ensuring correctness and clarity for each of the five trends and associated use cases.  \n8. Provide the final consolidated summary that includes the short version, the in-depth version, and additional context, if relevant.\n\n\n```"

                    "stringValue": "{\"answer\":\"### 1. Task outcome (short version):\\nThe leading forecasts from major analysts and experts for AI in 2025 highlight rapidly expanding AI investments, widespread enterprise adoption (especially of generative AI), the rise of self-governing or autonomous “agentic AI” systems, intensifying focus on AI ethics/governance, and broad real-world use cases across industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\n\\n• Growth and Market Size:\\n  – Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on generative AI alone could exceed $600 billion by 2025, a massive jump over prior years. Other estimates peg the generative AI market size at around $60+ billion in 2025, with an annual growth rate above 40% into 2030.\\n  – McKinsey estimates a total potential economic impact of AI at $4.4 trillion in productivity growth from business use cases, suggesting that large-scale AI deployments will be ubiquitous in 2025 and beyond.\\n\\n• Trend #1: Enterprise-Wide Operationalization of AI\\n  – According to Gartner research, up to 75% of enterprises are expected to operationalize AI by 2025, rising from below 15% in 2021. This adoption surge includes not only large corporations but also small and medium-sized companies ramping up AI-enabled processes.\\n\\n• Trend #2: Rapid Advancement of Generative AI\\n  – Generative AI (e.g., language models, image generators, code assistants) remains a top trend through 2025, with forecasts of significant investment, new products, and an evolution of existing business models. Deloitte projects that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents (autonomous software assistants) by 2025.\\n\\n• Trend #3: Emergence of “Agentic AI” / Autonomous AI\\n  – Gartner and Deloitte foresee the rise of more autonomous AI that can make decisions and learn continuously with minimal human oversight, sometimes referred to as “agentic AI.” The technology is expected to be transformative in areas requiring adaptive decision-making—for instance, dynamic supply chain management.\\n\\n• Trend #4: Increasing Emphasis on AI Governance, Ethics, and Regulation\\n  – Forbes and industry analyses stress that as AI becomes more pervasive, governance frameworks and regulatory compliance will grow in importance. Companies will need stricter controls around data handling, bias mitigation, and accountability to stay competitive and meet legal requirements.\\n\\n• Trend #5: Convergence of AI with Data Analytics and Cloud Platforms\\n  – A LinkedIn article and multiple expert reports (e.g., McKinsey) show that advanced analytics and cloud-based infrastructures will become even more entwined with AI solutions by 2025, speeding up data access, integration, and insights.\\n\\n• Major Use Cases by 2025:\\n  – Healthcare: Radiology diagnostics, patient triage, drug discovery, and personalized treatment.\\n  – Finance: Fraud detection, automated risk modeling, algorithmic trading, chatbots for customer service.\\n  – Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and robotics-driven automation.\\n  – Retail and E-commerce: Product recommendation engines, dynamic pricing, supply chain optimization.\\n  – Marketing & Customer Engagement: Automated content generation, sentiment analysis, and hyper-personalized targeting.\\n  – Workplace Productivity: AI assistants for scheduling, data analysis, and knowledge management.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n• The specific numerical forecasts can vary widely depending on methodology, but nearly all respected analysts (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, IDC, etc.) agree AI will continue its rapid expansion through 2025.\\n• “Generative AI” is a principal focus for many organizations, but more traditional forms of AI (machine learning-based analytics, computer vision, robotic process automation) continue to see strong adoption too.\\n• Key challenges that remain include availability of quality data, regulatory clarity, talent shortages, and organizational readiness. These factors may slow or accelerate adoption depending on how companies respond.\\n\"}"

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.\\n        question: The question to answer.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef search_agent(\\\"Your query goes here.\\\") -> str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nwhat are the AI trends in 2025\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n## 1.

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe leading forecasts from major analysts and experts for AI in 2025 highlight rapidly expanding AI investments, widespread enterprise adoption (especially of generative AI), the rise of self-governing or autonomous “agentic AI” systems, intensifying focus on AI ethics/governance, and broad real-world use cases across industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\n\\n• Growth and Market Size:\\n  – Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on generative AI alone could exceed $600 billion by 2025, a massive jump over prior years. Other estimates peg the generative AI market size at around $60+ billion in 2025, with an annual growth rate above 40% into 2030.\\n  – McKinsey estimates a total potential economic impact of AI at $4.4 trillion in productivity growth from business use cases, suggesting that large-scale AI deployments will be ubiquitous in 2025 and beyond.\\n\\n• Trend #1: Enterprise-Wide Operationalization of AI\\n  – According to Gartner research, up to 75% of enterprises are expected to operationalize AI by 2025, rising from below 15% in 2021. This adoption surge includes not only large corporations but also small and medium-sized companies ramping up AI-enabled processes.\\n\\n• Trend #2: Rapid Advancement of Generative AI\\n  – Generative AI (e.g., language models, image generators, code assistants) remains a top trend through 2025, with forecasts of significant investment, new products, and an evolution of existing business models. Deloitte projects that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents (autonomous software assistants) by 2025.\\n\\n• Trend #3: Emergence of “Agentic AI” / Autonomous AI\\n  – Gartner and Deloitte foresee the rise of more autonomous AI that can make decisions and learn continuously with minimal human oversight, sometimes referred to as “agentic AI.” The technology is expected to be transformative in areas requiring adaptive decision-making—for instance, dynamic supply chain management.\\n\\n• Trend #4: Increasing Emphasis on AI Governance, Ethics, and Regulation\\n  – Forbes and industry analyses stress that as AI becomes more pervasive, governance frameworks and regulatory compliance will grow in importance. Companies will need stricter controls around data handling, bias mitigation, and accountability to stay competitive and meet legal requirements.\\n\\n• Trend #5: Convergence of AI with Data Analytics and Cloud Platforms\\n  – A LinkedIn article and multiple expert reports (e.g., McKinsey) show that advanced analytics and cloud-based infrastructures will become even more entwined with AI solutions by 2025, speeding up data access, integration, and insights.\\n\\n• Major Use Cases by 2025:\\n  – Healthcare: Radiology diagnostics, patient triage, drug discovery, and personalized treatment.\\n  – Finance: Fraud detection, automated risk modeling, algorithmic trading, chatbots for customer service.\\n  – Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and robotics-driven automation.\\n  – Retail and E-commerce: Product recommendation engines, dynamic pricing, supply chain optimization.\\n  – Marketing & Customer Engagement: Automated content generation, sentiment analysis, and hyper-personalized targeting.\\n  – Workplace Productivity: AI assistants for scheduling, data analysis, and knowledge management.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n• The specific numerical forecasts can vary widely depending on methodology, but nearly all respected analysts (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, IDC, etc.) agree AI will continue its rapid expansion through 2025.\\n• “Generative AI” is a principal focus for many organizations, but more traditional forms of AI (machine learning-based analytics, computer vision, robotic process automation) continue to see strong adoption too.\\n• Key challenges that remain include availability of quality data, regulatory clarity, talent shortages, and organizational readiness.

Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n```python\ndef search_agent(\"Your query goes here.\") -> str:\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Task outcome (short version):\nThe leading forecasts from major analysts and experts for AI in 2025 highlight rapidly expanding AI investments, widespread enterprise adoption (especially of generative AI), the rise of self-governing or autonomous “agentic AI” systems, intensifying focus on AI ethics/governance, and broad real-world use cases across industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n\n• Growth and Market Size:\n  – Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on generative AI alone could exceed $600 billion by 2025, a massive jump over prior years. Other estimates peg the generative AI market size at around $60+ billion in 2025, with an annual growth rate above 40% into 2030.\n  – McKinsey estimates a total potential economic impact of AI at $4.4 trillion in productivity growth from business use cases, suggesting that large-scale AI deployments will be ubiquitous in 2025 and beyond.\n\n• Trend #1: Enterprise-Wide Operationalization of AI\n  – According to Gartner research, up to 75% of enterprises are expected to operationalize AI by 2025, rising from below 15% in 2021. This adoption surge includes not only large corporations but also small and medium-sized companies ramping up AI-enabled processes.\n\n• Trend #2: Rapid Advancement of Generative AI\n  – Generative AI (e.g., language models, image generators, code assistants) remains a top trend through 2025, with forecasts of significant investment, new products, and an evolution of existing business models. Deloitte projects that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents (autonomous software assistants) by 2025.\n\n• Trend #3: Emergence of “Agentic AI” / Autonomous AI\n  – Gartner and Deloitte foresee the rise of more autonomous AI that can make decisions and learn continuously with minimal human oversight, sometimes referred to as “agentic AI.” The technology is expected to be transformative in areas requiring adaptive decision-making—for instance, dynamic supply chain management.\n\n• Trend #4: Increasing Emphasis on AI Governance, Ethics, and Regulation\n  – Forbes and industry analyses stress that as AI becomes more pervasive, governance frameworks and regulatory compliance will grow in importance. Companies will need stricter controls around data handling, bias mitigation, and accountability to stay competitive and meet legal requirements.\n\n• Trend #5: Convergence of AI with Data Analytics and Cloud Platforms\n  – A LinkedIn article and multiple expert reports (e.g., McKinsey) show that advanced analytics and cloud-based infrastructures will become even more entwined with AI solutions by 2025, speeding up data access, integration, and insights.\n\n• Major Use Cases by 2025:\n  – Healthcare: Radiology diagnostics, patient triage, drug discovery, and personalized treatment.\n  – Finance: Fraud detection, automated risk modeling, algorithmic trading, chatbots for customer service.\n  – Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and robotics-driven automation.\n  – Retail and E-commerce: Product recommendation engines, dynamic pricing, supply chain optimization.\n  – Marketing & Customer Engagement: Automated content generation, sentiment analysis, and hyper-personalized targeting.\n  – Workplace Productivity: AI assistants for scheduling, data analysis, and knowledge management.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n• The specific numerical forecasts can vary widely depending on methodology, but nearly all respected analysts (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, IDC, etc.) agree AI will continue its rapid expansion through 2025.\n• “Generative AI” is a principal focus for many organizations, but more traditional forms of AI (machine learning-based analytics, computer vision, robotic process automation) continue to see strong adoption too.\n• Key challenges that remain include availability of quality data, regulatory clarity, talent shortages, and organizational readiness. These factors may slow or accelerate adoption depending on how companies respond.\n\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nHello!

Task outcome (short version):\nThe leading forecasts from major analysts and experts for AI in 2025 highlight rapidly expanding AI investments, widespread enterprise adoption (especially of generative AI), the rise of self-governing or autonomous “agentic AI” systems, intensifying focus on AI ethics/governance, and broad real-world use cases across industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n\n• Growth and Market Size:\n  – Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on generative AI alone could exceed $600 billion by 2025, a massive jump over prior years. Other estimates peg the generative AI market size at around $60+ billion in 2025, with an annual growth rate above 40% into 2030.\n  – McKinsey estimates a total potential economic impact of AI at $4.4 trillion in productivity growth from business use cases, suggesting that large-scale AI deployments will be ubiquitous in 2025 and beyond.\n\n• Trend #1: Enterprise-Wide Operationalization of AI\n  – According to Gartner research, up to 75% of enterprises are expected to operationalize AI by 2025, rising from below 15% in 2021. This adoption surge includes not only large corporations but also small and medium-sized companies ramping up AI-enabled processes.\n\n• Trend #2: Rapid Advancement of Generative AI\n  – Generative AI (e.g., language models, image generators, code assistants) remains a top trend through 2025, with forecasts of significant investment, new products, and an evolution of existing business models. Deloitte projects that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents (autonomous software assistants) by 2025.\n\n• Trend #3: Emergence of “Agentic AI” / Autonomous AI\n  – Gartner and Deloitte foresee the rise of more autonomous AI that can make decisions and learn continuously with minimal human oversight, sometimes referred to as “agentic AI.” The technology is expected to be transformative in areas requiring adaptive decision-making—for instance, dynamic supply chain management.\n\n• Trend #4: Increasing Emphasis on AI Governance, Ethics, and Regulation\n  – Forbes and industry analyses stress that as AI becomes more pervasive, governance frameworks and regulatory compliance will grow in importance. Companies will need stricter controls around data handling, bias mitigation, and accountability to stay competitive and meet legal requirements.\n\n• Trend #5: Convergence of AI with Data Analytics and Cloud Platforms\n  – A LinkedIn article and multiple expert reports (e.g., McKinsey) show that advanced analytics and cloud-based infrastructures will become even more entwined with AI solutions by 2025, speeding up data access, integration, and insights.\n\n• Major Use Cases by 2025:\n  – Healthcare: Radiology diagnostics, patient triage, drug discovery, and personalized treatment.\n  – Finance: Fraud detection, automated risk modeling, algorithmic trading, chatbots for customer service.\n  – Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and robotics-driven automation.\n  – Retail and E-commerce: Product recommendation engines, dynamic pricing, supply chain optimization.\n  – Marketing & Customer Engagement: Automated content generation, sentiment analysis, and hyper-personalized targeting.\n  – Workplace Productivity: AI assistants for scheduling, data analysis, and knowledge management.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n• The specific numerical forecasts can vary widely depending on methodology, but nearly all respected analysts (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, IDC, etc.) agree AI will continue its rapid expansion through 2025.\n• “Generative AI” is a principal focus for many organizations, but more traditional forms of AI (machine learning-based analytics, computer vision, robotic process automation) continue to see strong adoption too.\n• Key challenges that remain include availability of quality data, regulatory clarity, talent shortages, and organizational readiness. These factors may slow or accelerate adoption depending on how companies respond.\n\"\"\")\n```\n"
